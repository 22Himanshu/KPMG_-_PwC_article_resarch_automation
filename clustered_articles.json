        "date_published": "2025-04-02",
        "published_content": "On 30 December 2025, the European Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EUDR) will become applicable. The new rules aim to guarantee that the products consumed in Europe do not contribute to deforestation or forest degradation worldwide. They will have a significant impact on business and transform entire industries.\n\nThe EUDR aims to prevent deforestation-linked products from entering the EU market. By reducing the EU\u2019s impact on deforestation and forest degradation, the regulation aims to bring down greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and biodiversity loss.\n\nThe regulation requires companies trading in select commodities, known as the main drivers of deforestation, and the derived products from those commodities to conduct due diligence on their value chain. By encouraging organizations to source responsibly, these new rules play a critical role in enhancing traceability in global supply chains.\n\nWhile the primary responsibility lies with the company placing the products on the EU market, the regulation affects the upstream value chain with non-EU companies expected to provide information to their customers. Therefore, Swiss groups trading and exporting the in-scope commodities to the EU can be directly or indirectly impacted by the regulation.\n\nIn December 2024, the European Union granted an additional 12-month phasing-in period to comply with the regulation, giving companies more time to prepare. The regulation is now applicable on 30 December 2025 for large and medium operators and traders, while micro and small enterprises will have until 30 June 2026 to comply.\n\nWhile the Information System for companies to submit their due diligence statements is ready and classification of countries that present a low or high risk shall be published no later than 30 June 2025, companies still have until the end of the year to comply. Despite the EUDR\u2019s delay, companies are encouraged to start now by considering the impacts of the EUDR on their products and supply chain due diligence.\n\nSwiss groups trading and exporting the in-scope commodities to the EU may be directly or indirectly affected by the regulation and will need to consider a centrally managed approach for companies within the group. Swiss businesses trading and exporting the in-scope commodities to the EU will be required to provide information on the commodities they export to the EU market. This means that they will need to ensure that the commodities they source are not linked to deforestation and may need to demonstrate compliance with the regulation to investors.\n\nSwiss financial institutions are not currently subject to the EUDR regulation, although this could change as the European Commission has committed to conduct an impact assessment to evaluate the role of financial institutions in preventing financial flows that contribute directly or indirectly to deforestation and forest degradation by no later than 30 June 2025.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the impact assessment, financial institutions are indirectly exposed to the regulation through their investments in companies that trade and export the in-scope commodities to the EU. As deforestation poses substantial risks to many companies, they pose risks to the instruments in which financial institutions invest.\n\nCompanies that place the in-scope commodities on the EU market or export them from the EU must ensure that they: are not produced on deforested or degraded land since 31 December 2020, have been produced in accordance with the laws of the country of production, and are covered by a due diligence statement\n\nEUDR compliance is complex because it involves a variety of information and expertise from multiple sources. There are many internal and external challenges that companies face and need to resolve to ensure compliance with the regulation. Internal challenges range from getting relevant functions (e.g., Legal, Purchasing, IT, etc.) onboard to setting up the right governance structure and implementing the right technology, while external challenges lie in supplier engagement and data collection.\n\nStarting with the internal challenges, one key challenge may be to determine who is responsible for implementing the required measures to comply with the regulation as there are different functions involved in that process. Another internal challenge is internal traceability as the identification of products in scope can be complex and requires internal traceability from the purchase of raw materials to the selling and shipping of products.\n\nOther key challenges relate to the traceability of commodities in complex global supply chains and the potential use of technology to achieve traceability and demonstrate compliance with the EUDR requirements. Companies that don\u2019t have technological solutions in place may need to consider identifying the right technology before deploying it with their partners along the value chain.\n\nDisruption of supply chains is another key challenge companies may face where suppliers struggle to comply with the EUDR requirements and demand for eligible raw materials outpaces availability. Companies will need to closely engage with their suppliers through awareness raising, collaboration and data collection. Moreover, in a context of geopolitical tensions, resource scarcity and limited supply, they may need to redefine their sourcing strategy on select commodities and potentially look for new suppliers.\n\nThe implementation of due diligence (e.g., applicability assessment, selection and audit of suppliers, evidence of compliance with the laws of the country of production) combined with the sourcing of sustainable raw materials could lead to increased costs.\n\nConsequences of non-compliance should not be underestimated. Beyond the reputational damage companies may suffer, penalties for non-compliance with the EUDR include fines which can amount to 4% of the entity\u2019s total annual EU turnover, confiscation of products and revenue, prohibition from commercial activities within the EU; and exclusion from public tenders.\n\nCompliance with the EUDR can be challenging, but it is also an opportunity to refine your ESG strategy, review your internal policies and processes as well as enhance traceability in your supply chains. Starting with an impact assessment and a gap analysis, companies first need to assess their compliance readiness to the regulation.\n\nOnce they are clear on the regulation\u2019s impact on their products and supply chains and are aware of the gaps they need to close to meet the requirements of the regulation, they can design or strengthen their due diligence framework and engage with their suppliers. Leveraging this work, companies can respond to and anticipate other relevant EU regulations (e.g. Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, etc.).\n\nCompanies are given extra time to comply with the regulation, but they need to start now because implementation of the regulation can be timely and challenging. Companies need to adopt a structured approach to ensure they meet every aspect of the regulation. KPMG\u2019s multidisciplinary expertise and global presence can help companies navigate the complexities of the EUDR\u2019s journey by assisting companies in performing readiness assessments and supporting them with the implementation of due diligence from supplier engagement to deployment of technology and submission of due diligence statements.\n\nWe can help you turn compliance into opportunity by establishing a transformation roadmap that will help you prepare for other relevant upcoming EU regulations.\n\nThe EU deforestation regulation (EUDR) poses new challenges for companies trading with the EU. KPMG Switzerland provides a structured approach to help companies assess their readiness, navigate compliance and implement effective solutions.\n\nOur experts assist with readiness assessments, awareness workshops and the evaluation of technology solutions to ensure sustainable and transparent supply chains.",

Other big deals included Anthropic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $4.5 billion (two closings), Infinite Reality \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $3 billion, Binance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $2 billion, Groq \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $1.5 billion, DayOne \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $1.2 billion, and X \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $1 billion.\nGlobal highlights of Q1'25\nVC investment rises to $126.3 billion across 7551 deals\nMedian late-stage valuations rebound\nInvestment into AI surges powered by mega deals\nVenture fundraising remains muted year over year\nAI dominates top 10 deals, led by OpenAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $40 billion raise\nUS attracts over two-thirds of VC funding globally in Q1\u00e2\u0080\u009925\nVC investment in the Americas surged in Q1 2025, driven by a series of megadeals, while Europe saw more muted growth and Asia experienced another quarterly decline, reaching record low investment levels. Deal volume dropped across all regions, as investors remained cautious amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nThe US retained its position as the top destination for VC funding, bolstered by several high-profile raises, including OpenAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $40 billion raise, Anthropic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $4.5 billion raise (two closings), and Infinite Reality\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $3 billion raise in the augmented reality space. Europe ranked second in total VC investment, led by Binance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $2 billion raise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest of the quarter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 followed by German proptech firm Reneo, which secured $624 million. Asia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s VC market remained soft, with just three deals exceeding $500 million. Singapore-based datacentre firm DayOne led with a $1.2 billion raise, followed by China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cleantech company SE Environmental ($688 million) and India-based e-commerce platform Meesho ($550 million).\nHot AI space attracting diversity of deals across jurisdictions\nAI plays continued to dominate the VC market in Q1\u00e2\u0080\u009925. While the largest deals in the AI sector occurred in the US led, by OpenAI, Anthropic and Infinite Reality, other regions also saw robust AI investments. In Europe, AI-enabled industry solutions companies raised a number of $100 million funding rounds, including Sweden-based preventative healthtech company Neko Health ($260 million) and UK-based AI-powered video communications company Synthesia ($180 million). Asia also saw a number of significant AI-focused raises, including China-based Neolix Technologies ($137 million) and Univista ($137 million), Australia-based Harrison.ai ($111 million), Hong Kong (SAR) and Boston-based InSilico Medicine ($100 million), and India-based Spotdraft ($54 million).\nLooking at the AI space more broadly, the launch of China-based DeepSeek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s R1 AI model sent ripples across the globe in Q1\u00e2\u0080\u009925. DeepSeek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch was followed closely by new AI models by Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba. The launch of the three models so close together \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all purporting to be more energy efficient than others built to date \u00e2\u0080\u0094 highlights the intense competition globally and regionally for market dominance in the large language model (LLM) space.\nGeopolitical uncertainties and tensions driving VC investment into defense tech and spacetech\nAs competition heated up in the AI space worldwide, a number of governments made substantive moves in order to promote, encourage, and accelerate AI development. During the quarter, the US announced The Stargate Project, which aims to spend $500 billion on developing next gen AI infrastructure in the US.\nThis was followed by the European Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement of its InvestAI program&nbsp;\u00e2\u0080\u0094 a plan to drive $206 billion into AI innovation, including the development of gigafactories \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and France\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement of $112 billion in AI investment commitments.&nbsp;During the quarter, China also announced a $138 billion national venture capital guidance fund to invest in a range of priority sectors, including AI and quantum computing.\nAlternative energy continues to attract interest globally\nInterest in defense tech continued to grow in Q1\u00e2\u0080\u009925, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions. The US saw the largest defense tech deals during the quarter, including a $600 million raise by Saronic Technologies, a $240 million raise by ShieldAI, and a $250 million raise by Epirus. Spacetech also continued to grow on the radar of investors. Japan in particular saw several deals during the quarter, including raises by ArkEdge Space ($51 million) and Interstellar Technologies ($45 million).\nTrends to watch for in Q1\u00e2\u0080\u009925\nHeading into Q2\u00e2\u0080\u009925, AI is expected to remain the primary driver of VC investment globally. Industry-focused AI solutions are likely to attract growing interest, alongside advanced robotics and enabling technologies such as LIDAR. Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, sectors like defence-tech and cybersecurity are also projected to see increased VC activity.\nHowever, VC investment may begin the quarter on a slower note as investors await greater clarity on the escalating global trade war and its potential economic ramifications. Global M&A activity could accelerate in Q2\u00e2\u0080\u009925 and beyond, particularly in the AI space, as major tech companies seek to acquire promising startups before valuations rise further. The recently announced $32 billion deal for Google to acquire Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz \u00e2\u0080\u0094 announced prior to the U.S. administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariff announcements \u00e2\u0080\u0094 may serve as a catalyst for increased M&A activity, particularly within the cybersecurity and broader tech sectors. In the face of continued IPO uncertainty, M&A remains a compelling alternative for companies seeking strategic exits.\nWe headed into Q1\u00e2\u0080\u009925 with some cautious optimism around a renewed sense of business confidence, more investment and more exit activity. That optimism has now abated in the face of the uncertainty caused by various executive orders and the back and forth on tariffs and trade. With expectations for the recovery of the IPO market moving farther out again, we could see a shift in VC firms needing to reallocate investment priorities as some companies may need additional funding prior to a now more distant IPO.\nConor Moore\nGlobal Head, KPMG Private Enterprise, KPMG International\nPartner, KPMG in the US\nFootnotes\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/tech/openai-oracle-softbank-trump-ai-investment/index.html\nhttps://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/latest/news/commission-launches-new-investai-initiative-mobilise-eu200-billion-investment-ai\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/details-110-billion-euros-investment-pledges-frances-ai-summit-2025-02-10/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-set-up-national-venture-capital-guidance-fund-state-planner-says-2025-03-06/\nData presented correct as of April 16th 2025, and is subject to change.\nWhy work with KPMG in Thailand\nKPMG in Thailand, with more than 2,500 professionals offering Audit and Assurance, Legal, Tax, and Advisory services, is a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.",

For more context, this figure is more than twice as high as 2020, where CEO growth confidence was a mere 20%.\nDespite the impact of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full-scale invasion and the ensuing geopolitical and economic uncertainty, Ukrainian business has demonstrated unprecedented resilience and continues to grow, with a market that is more open to investment than ever.\nIn such times, navigating the Ukrainian business landscape can be complex but also rewarding, and our guidance can give you the clarity you need to take on both challenges and opportunities.\nWe offer a comprehensive guide to help you deal with issues such as how to start a business in Ukraine, what you need to know about tax regulations, how currency restrictions might affect your business, how to insure your company against war risks, what the rules are regarding investment legislation, how to obtain all the necessary licences and permits, and many other useful insights that will help you simplify your business decisions.\nWe also provide you with a broad macroeconomic overview of Ukraine and explore the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s key industries to better support your strategic planning.\nKPMG in Ukraine became a member of the KPMG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEE cluster in 2022. Together with teams from the KPMG network, we are currently using our expertise and inspiration to help rebuild Ukraine.\nLaunched in 2024, the KPMG Ukraine Gateway initiative focuses on renewal and redevelopment for Ukrainian businesses. We work with donor organisations, the Government of Ukraine, and the EU to create opportunities for international investment and sustainable development.\nKPMG is proud to be your strategic partner in the fulfilling task of taking an active hand in Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reconstruction process. Together, we can help make a difference in Ukraine: taking positive steps for business, for people, and for communities. Treat our practical guide as your essential handbook for starting a business in Ukraine. Staying abreast of broader economic trends and industry opportunities, as well as enhancing your understanding of the Ukrainian legal system, will enable you to make informed decisions about the local market environment.",

But these numbers only tell part of the story, as Q3 and Q4'24 saw very different results; M&A deal value almost doubled from $7.4 billion to $14.2 billion compared to the previous quarter, while venture capital investment increased from $9.7 billion to $11.2 billion during the same period.\nAs Am\u00c3\u00a9ricas foram respons\u00c3\u00a1veis pela maior parte do investimento em fintech no segundo semestre de 2014 (31 mil milh\u00c3\u00b5es de d\u00c3\u00b3lares), incluindo os \u00c3\u00banicos neg\u00c3\u00b3cios superiores a mil milh\u00c3\u00b5es de d\u00c3\u00b3lares (Nuvei \u00e2\u0080\u0093 6,3 mil milh\u00c3\u00b5es de d\u00c3\u00b3lares, Envestnet \u00e2\u0080\u0093 4,5 mil milh\u00c3\u00b5es de d\u00c3\u00b3lares, Candescent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2,45 mil milh\u00c3\u00b5es de d\u00c3\u00b3lares, Transact Campus \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1,6 mil milh\u00c3\u00b5es de d\u00c3\u00b3lares, Bridge \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1,1 mil milh\u00c3\u00b5es de d\u00c3\u00b3lares).

        "published_content": "We are pleased to share with you the third edition of our quarterly KPMG Financial Performance Index (FPI) publication. This publication provides insights into the changing state of corporate health across all companies listed and headquarter in Singapore across all sectors, following the end of the reporting season for the three months to September 2024. KPMG FPI data is refreshed on a quarterly basis. For more information, visit the KPMG FPI\u00a0page.\nFrom June to September 2024, Singapore's financial corporate health saw a slight decline in FPI scores from 83.0 to 80.5. Scores for Infrastructure and Real Estate (72.1 to 79.9), Healthcare (68.9 to 74.3), and Travel and Hospitality (91.3 to 95.4) improved. However, Utilities (93.5 to 65.4) and Trading Companies and Distributors (70.1 to 50.6) declined.\nSingapore's zombie company count doubled from 4 to 9 in 3Q24, mirroring the broader Asian trend where counts rose from 173 to 294.\u00a0\nEconomic data exhibits strong resilience with GDP growth accelerating to 5.4% in Q3 2024, underpinned by controlled inflation metrics (CPI-All Items 2.4%, core inflation 2.1%) and robust labor market performance across both resident and non-resident categories, strengthened by trade-related and modern services clusters that outperform regional peers including Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand.\nGovernment's proactive economic initiatives, focusing on infrastructure development projects and enhanced R&D support, combined with strategic labor market adjustments and effective monetary policies, position Singapore favorably for sustained growth despite potential impacts from upcoming US elections and projected inflation moderation to 1.0%-2.0% in 2025.\nInfrastructure & Real Estate sector demonstrates robust growth driven by strategic government housing initiatives and sustained commercial demand. The sector's resilience is evidenced by successful affordable housing programs, coupled with the office market's dynamic adaptation to hybrid work models and Singapore's positioning as a technology hub. Additionally, the industrial segment exhibits strong performance metrics, particularly in logistics and warehousing facilities, indicating a well-balanced sector growth trajectory.\nHealthcare sector shows significant recovery, primarily attributed to the revival of international tourism and enhanced regional connectivity. Market performance is notably strengthened by key revenue-generating markets including Mainland China, Indonesia, and Australia, signaling successful market diversification strategies.\nEnergy sector exhibits strategic transformation through focused investments in sustainable solutions, including clean energy infrastructure and regional power integration initiatives. Growth projections are underpinned by increasing electricity demand, driven by economic expansion, demographic growth, and the rapidly scaling data center industry, positioning the sector for sustainable long-term development.\nUtilities sector experiences margin pressure amid market challenges, characterised by energy price volatility and intensifying competition. A dominant player in Singapore's electricity and gas market, faces profitability constraints due to escalating energy costs while maintaining strategic investments in grid modernisation and renewable energy infrastructure.\nTrading Companies and Distributors sector shows performance decline, impacted by global trade dynamics and supply chain disruptions. The sector's challenges are amplified by ongoing international trade tensions and residual pandemic-related supply chain constraints, significantly affecting companies focused on cross-border trade operations.\nTechnology and Telecommunications sector encounters growth headwinds, stemming from decelerated global tech spending and market competition intensity. Key industry players face revenue growth challenges while balancing competitive pressures with strategic technology investments, particularly in 5G infrastructure development.\nSingapore's economic performance in Q2-Q3 2024 demonstrates remarkable resilience, with GDP growth accelerating from 2.9% to 5.4% in Q3. This growth trajectory is underpinned by controlled inflation metrics, with CPI-All Items at 2.4% and core inflation at 2.1%, alongside a robust labor market showing strong employment growth across both resident and non-resident categories.\nSingapore maintains a strong competitive position among regional peers, outperforming Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand. This success is primarily attributed to robust performance in trade-related and modern services clusters, positioning Singapore advantageously in global trade and services demand.\nThe government's strategic initiatives demonstrate a comprehensive approach to economic development, focusing on infrastructure projects like Guoco Midtown and Greater Southern Waterfront, enhanced R&D support, and skill development programs. These are complemented by proactive inflation management through monetary policy and targeted subsidies.\nLooking forward, key considerations include potential impacts from the US elections on trade policies and investment flows, with inflation expected to moderate to 1.0%-2.0% in 2025. The continued adjustment of labor market policies to attract and retain skilled workforce, combined with strong economic fundamentals and effective policy measures, positions Singapore favorably for sustained growth despite global challenges.\nZombies are defined as companies close to default (scoring 0 on the KPMG FPI) for three or more consecutive quarters. These businesses might already be facing challenges or implementing restructuring plans.\nIn Asia, the count of zombies has grown each quarter, rising from 173 in 2Q24 to 294 in 3Q24. The leading sectors with the most significant shares of zombies are Infrastructure and Real Estate at 20.6%, followed by Consumer Markets and Technology and Telecommunications both at 13.3%.\nSingapore\u2019s count of zombies similarly increased from 4 to 9 in 3Q24. Sectors reporting zombies are Technology and Telecommunication (2), Infrastructure and Real Estate (1), Trading Companies and Distributors (1), Agriculture and Husbandry (1), Manufacturing (1), Business Services (1), Energy (1) and Media and Entertainment (1).\nTo understand your company\u2019s current index score, or to uncover deeper insights about specific markets or segments, contact us today.\u00a0KPMG\u2019s global network of professionals\u00a0have the data, sector, and geographic expertise to help you understand your score and tie it back to your business needs.

        "article_url": "https://kpmg.com/uk/en/insights/finance/frs-102-amendments.html",
        "date_published": "2025-04-16",
        "published_content": "The upcoming amendments to FRS 102, which among other changes introduce IFRS-like revenue and lease accounting to UK GAAP reporters, have been published since March 2024. Many companies are preparing to implement the standards by starting impact assessments, preparing accounting papers, considering system requirements, and understanding where transition adjustments might arise.\nFor an overview of the amendments and what they mean, read our article for an overview of revenue and lease changes, and our other recent article for an overview of other changes.\nOne of the questions most companies ask us is: \u2018what is the transition going to look like in my accounts, practically?\u2019\nHelpfully, the FRS 102 amendments were designed to be easier to implement than their IFRS counterparts, IFRS 15 and 16. Below we discuss transition options available, whether comparatives are restated, and some of the expedients available when applying the amendments to save you time and effort.\nLeases as a lessee\nComparatives\nUnlike IFRS 16, to introduce simplicity, the amendments only offer one approach: comparatives are not restated. Instead, existing operating leases are recognised as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities using the remaining lease payments at transition date, and existing finance lease accounting is carried forward without the need to revisit the discount rate at the transition. Any difference arising from transition is recognised in equity.\nGroup reporting to IFRS parent\nIf the FRS 102 company is consolidated into an IFRS parent, the amendments allow IFRS 16 group reporting balances to be applied on the transition date. I.e. the group lease accounting can be pushed down into the FRS 102 subsidiary, saving time in determining transition adjustments.\nLease definition\nThe FRC have provided an optional expedient to apply the updated lease definition prospectively from transition. If taken, the new definition won\u2019t be applied to arrangements entered into prior to transition, saving reassessment of whether complex arrangements meet the definition of a lease.\nHindsight for judgements\nThe use of hindsight is allowed at the date of transition. Judgements regarding lease term such as options to extend or break a lease are made at the transition date \u2013 not back in time to the start of the lease.\nLease exemptions\nThe short-term lease and low-value assets exemptions also apply from the date of transition, not just to new leases entered into after transition. For example, a 5-year lease with only 10 months remaining at transition would be eligible for the short-term exemption.\nDiscount rate\nA single discount rate can be applied to a portfolio of leases if they have similar characteristics, saving time compared to calculating a different discount rate for each individual lease. As highlighted in our leases article, the amendments offer a simplified approach to determining lease discount rates, allowing the use of an \u2018obtainable\u2019 rather than \u2018incremental\u2019 borrowing rate.\nOther changes\nRevenue\nUnlike leases, FRS 102 preparers have a choice of two transition options. Either to restate comparatives, or not restate comparatives and recognise the effect of transition adjustments in equity on the transition date. If the restatement approach is chosen, then in certain instances hindsight can be applied for variable consideration and modifications \u2013 choosing to take this approach would result in a different restatement approach to leases, where comparatives are restated for revenue, but not for lease adjustments.\nSupplier financing disclosures\n(applicable from 1/1/25, a year before the other amendments): No supplier financing disclosures are required in the comparative period.\nFair value measurement\nThe fair value amendments apply prospectively from transition, with no retrospective adjustments or comparative changes.\nBusiness combinations\nThe amendments only apply to either new business combinations on or after transition, or provisional acqusition accounting at the date of transition.\nUncertain tax treatments\nSimilar to revenue, FRS 102 preparers have a choice of two transition options. Either to restate comparatives, or not restate comparatives and recognise the effect of transition adjustments in equity on the transition date.\nOther\nAll other changes not discussed here simply apply retrospectively with comparatives restated (for example, changes related to share-based payments and intangible assets).\nHow can we help?\nKPMG\u2019s Accounting Advisory Services team are on hand to help and support preparers with implementation of the FRS 102 amendments.\nTypically, implementation starts with a workshop to kick off the project and upskill your team, followed by an impact assessment, preparation of accounting papers, quantification and disclosure. Do please reach out if you would like to talk to our specialists \u2013 there is now less than a year until the transition date!",

        "published_content": "In an era marked by geopolitical uncertainty, evolving regulations and rapid technological advancements, tax leaders face unprecedented challenges. The global tax landscape is more dynamic than ever, with jurisdictions implementing measures to protect their tax bases and incentivize climate-friendly investments. Additionally, the rise of generative AI (Gen AI) and the shortage of tax talent are reshaping traditional tax roles and operating models, putting significant stress on tax functions. Navigating the forces of change in tax  explores these complexities, offering strategic imperatives and actionable insights to help tax leaders navigate the forces of change. The publication highlights three key areas tax leaders should prioritize to create value for their organizations and outlines key steps to help achieve these goals and gain a competitive advantage.\nKey Themes\nCoping with a dynamic and unpredictable tax environment\nTax functions are under immense pressure due to evolving regulations and fast-changing global events. For instance, 79 percent of respondents in the KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook believe trade regulation will negatively impact their organizations, while 56 percent express concerns about regulatory demands.\nMaking Gen AI work for tax\nGenerative AI (Gen AI) is set to revolutionize tax practices by automating compliance, enhancing data analysis, and improving decision-making processes. The KPMG 2024 CTO Outlook Study indicates that 29 percent of tax functions are already deploying Gen AI, with an additional 26 percent exploring its use.\nElevating and empowering tax teams for tomorrow\nWith the growing demand for skills in emerging technologies, tax leaders must focus on building agile teams equipped to handle the complexities of modern tax environments. The KPMG Global Tax Function Benchmarking Survey reveals that 44 percent of respondents identify employee recruitment and retention as the biggest disruptor impacting the corporate tax function.\nA Nordic point-of-view of the tax function today\nThe current landscape of tax functions in the Nordics is marked by increasing compliance demands and evolving tax policies, which challenge organizations to adapt swiftly and strategically. Embracing technological advancements, particularly Generative AI, emerges as a crucial solution, enabling tax teams to manage compliance efficiently while freeing up resources for strategic initiatives. As tax professionals navigate the complexities of regulatory changes and geopolitical challenges, leveraging AI not only enhances productivity and compliance but also positions organizations to gain a competitive edge in an uncertain future. By focusing on technology, transparency and adaptability, tax functions can transform into strategic partners that drive value and resilience in a rapidly changing environment.\nKey actions to help transform the tax function for the future\nDespite these challenges, there are significant opportunities for organizations to transform their operating models and enhance their strategic role within the business. By evolving in tandem with other business functions, tax teams can deliver greater value and position themselves for success in an unpredictable future. Some steps to consider when building a tax function ready for the future include:\nReappraising the operating model\nRedesigning the target operating model with a focus on governance, process optimization, people capabilities, service delivery models, technology enhancements, and performance insights.\nDeveloping a business case and managing stakeholders effectively\nCreating objectives and key results (OKRs) to measure and communicate the success of transformation efforts.\nRefining tax governance\nImplementing responsible tax policies that align with ESG (environmental, social, and governance) principles to enhance company reputation and help reduce audit risks.\nBuilding a robust risk governance framework\nIdentifying geopolitical risks and preparing for various future scenarios.\nPositioning performance in terms of value delivered\nHighlighting the tax function\u2019s dual roles as a compliance function and strategic business partner through key performance indicators (KPIs).\nExperimenting and iterating\nTaking an agile approach to tax transformation by experimenting with discrete operational areas and building on successes.",

        "published_content": "On 2 April 2025, President Donald Trump launched several tariffs targeted at an unprecedented number of countries. The new tariffs will impact many countries, not just those with which the United States has a significant trade deficit. The tariff rate will vary depending on the country, with ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand among those seeing the most significant impacts.\nAccording to the Executive Order, published by the White House, two new types of tariffs will be implemented:\na baseline 10% tariff on all goods imported into the United States from all countries, which is in effect on 5 April 2025; and\na \u00e2\u0080\u0098reciprocal tariff\u00e2\u0080\u0099 imposed on 60 additional countries, further increasing the tariff rate for countries with which the United States has the largest trade deficits (please refer to Annex I, List of countries and territories receiving reciprocal tariffs signed by the President of the United States), starting from 9 April 2025. Thailand is included in this group and is subject to a tariff rate of around 36%.\nIt is important to note that on 9 April 2025, President Donald Trump announced a reduction in tariff rates on imports from most US trade partners to 10% for a period of 90 days. This measure is intended to facilitate trade negotiations with these countries.\nMeanwhile, a 25% tariff on all foreign-made automobiles was implemented on 3 April 2025.\nProducts which will not be subject to the new tariffs include: (1) articles subject to 50 USC 1702(b); (2) steel/aluminum articles, autos, and auto parts already subject to Section 232 tariffs; (3) copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber articles; (4) all articles that may become subject to future Section 232 tariffs; (5) bullion; and (6) energy and other certain minerals that are not available in the United States (please refer to Annex II, List of products excluded from reciprocal tariffs signed by the President of the United States).\nThe Information and Communication Technology Center, Ministry of Commerce of Thailand, in collaboration with the Customs Department, has released information listing the products exported by Thailand to the United States in 2024 that would be most affected by the reciprocal tariff, such as telephones, telephone equipment and accessories, computers and computer equipment, automotive parts, jewelry, machinery, semiconductors, electronics, and electrical equipment.\nThe new tariffs are likely to have an extensive impact on many companies that are currently exporting, or looking to export, to the United States. The Thai government has already set up a team to negotiate with the United States and has prepared a draft strategy in response to the new US trade policies.\nThese new tariffs of the United States, and the retaliatory tariffs imposed by other major countries, may also have an indirect impact on several other industries, resulting from a sudden diversion of trade.\nIt is strongly recommended that companies undertake a thorough review of their current supply chain in order to find ways to reduce the impact of these new tariffs. KPMG can provide:\nanalysis of the impacts of the new tariff regime on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost and pricing structure, and recommendations for ways to minimize the impact of these changes;\nreviews to ensure goods are classified under the correct HS code, which may result in lower duty rates;\nrecommendations for optimization of companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 supply chains, in order to benefit from more favorable tariff rates offered by other countries;\nadvice on the regulations and procedures for exporting products to the US, ensuring compliance with Thai and American regulations, and meeting the complex requirements of various government bodies.\nKPMG in Thailand has extensive experience in helping Thai and foreign MNEs navigate major changes in the tariff landscape and reduce the impacts on their supply chains.

        "published_content": "A successful transformation is a fundamental shift in the way an organization does business that spans departments, functions, and business units, and delivers significant company-wide improvements.\nEmbarking on a journey of business transformation presents numerous challenges for organizations striving to stay competitive in today's dynamic market. At KPMG, we understand the complexity of these challenges and offer specialized services to address them head-on. From navigating the complexities of digital transformation to managing organizational change effectively, our strategic consulting provides tailored solutions to meet your unique needs. We specialize in guiding clients through the complexity of change management and innovation, ensuring seamless process optimization and technology integration. With a focus on enterprise agility and transformational leadership, we help clients tackle the hurdles of business process reengineering and performance improvement. Our expertise in organizational development and strategy execution equips clients with the tools needed to overcome obstacles and drive business innovation.\nThe top objective for business transformation is to create value: Improve business performance (ROI) and grow market share. But what are the hurdles in the process? KPMG surveyed both top leaders and middle managers to get their insights on the opportunities and challenges on business transformation today. The top three challenges when implementing transformation in an organization are the following:\n Increased complexity and intensity\nBy definition, a transformation involves a significant change \u2014 the digitization of a critical process, adopting a new go-to-market model, or modernizing a support function. Today, large corporations typically undertake multiple transformations simultaneously. In our executive survey, two thirds of respondents said that there are typically three or more transformation programs running simultaneously in their organizations. Sixty percent say that transformation has become continuous or nearly so.\nTechnological capability gaps\nAcross industries, top leaders in the survey said that proper alignment of people and capabilities is the most important factor in a successful transformation. However, they also acknowledge the challenges of getting the right people and the right technology in place. In our recent survey on how executives expect to adopt generative AI \u2014 a technology that is bound to play leading role in future transformations \u2014 only 22 percent of executives said that they were confident that their company has the right technology and data infrastructure for generative AI, and 15 percent felt their company has the right people in place to integrate generative AI into the business.\nManaging execution risks\nExecutives and middle managers agree that execution risk is growing in transformations. Loss of momentum remains a top threat. The focus of top leaders is diverted from the transformation by other priorities, especially when there is turnover at the top. When focus shifts away, leaders lose credibility with managers and staff. That adds to the people and culture challenges that undermine transformation. Leaders need to be steadfast and stay visibly committed through their actions and words to the change. Get more insights in the new transformation agenda.",

Each edition presents industry commentary and analysis on the performance of the sector, together with a range of topical articles from industry experts, regulators and our own business leaders.\nBanking sector growth in 2024:\nKPMG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s survey of the banking sector results for 2024 reveals that the sector has demonstrated resilience despite ongoing economic challenges, with a net profit after tax (NPAT) of $7.22 billion for 2024 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a slight increase of 0.25% from 2023.\nThis relatively flat growth comes alongside a 2.23% increase in net interest income to $15.69 billion, fuelled by loan growth of 3.05% while net interest margins remained stable at 2.34%. However, the sector faced headwinds with an 8.07% rise in operating expenses driven by personnel costs, technology costs, and the impact of inflation, and slight relief from a 32.75% decrease in impaired asset expense.\n2024 has been a year of resilience for the sector, with participants and their customers navigating the economic headwinds and focusing on maintaining stability. Despite these challenges, the sector has managed to sustain its profitability, reflecting the robustness of New Zealand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s banking institutions.\nThe clearest message we received from survey participants was that they see New Zealand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sluggish economy, with low growth, poor productivity, and stretched infrastructure, as requiring investment - some of which will need to come from offshore. Participants stated that to attract such funding, we need to be investor-friendly with a stable and consistent set of policies.\nKey figures:\nNet profit after tax increased by $17.95 million (0.25%) to $7.22 billion;\nNet interest income increased by $342.57 million (2.23%) to $15.69 billion;\nNon-interest income increased by $30.75 million (1.40%) to $2.23 billion;\nOperating expenses (including amortisation) increased by $557.43 million (8.07%) to $7.46 billion;\nNet interest margin remained stable at 2.34%;\nImpaired asset expense decreased by $209.55 million (32.75%) to $0.43 billion; and\nTax expenses increased by $7.49 million (0.27%) to $2.81 billion.\nWe hope you enjoyed this report and would be delighted to discuss its content and insights in further detail.\nPlease get in touch if you have any questions or would like to schedule a conversation.",

This strong performance builds on the influx of large IPOs completed in the late 2024 and has been further bolstered by the growing popularity of DeepSeek, which has shifted global investor interest towards Chinese Mainland tech companies.\nThe growing momentum is further reflected in the IPO pipeline, which now includes 120 applicants, up from 86 as at 31 December 2024. The uptick can be attributed to 51 companies submitting their first application during the quarter, up from 24 in the previous quarter. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cA+H\u00e2\u0080\u009d listing model has also gained traction, with one-fourth of those new applications coming from companies already listed on the A-share market.\nThe Hong Kong Stock Exchange recently reviewed its regulatory framework concerning the IPO price discovery process and open market requirements. Proposed measures aim to provide greater flexibility for companies in managing their capital structure and enhancing liquidity, particularly for those listing through the \u00e2\u0080\u009cA+H\u00e2\u0080\u009d listing model.",

Other big deals included Anthropic \u2014 $4.5 billion (two closings), Infinite Reality \u2014 $3 billion, Binance \u2014 $2 billion, Groq \u2014 $1.5 billion, DayOne \u2014 $1.2 billion, and X \u2014 $1 billion.\nGlobal highlights of Q1'25\nVC investment rises to $126.3 billion across 7551 dealsMedian late-stage valuations reboundInvestment into AI surges powered by mega dealsVenture fundraising remains muted year over yearAI dominates top 10 deals, led by OpenAI\u2019s $40 billion raise\nUS attracts over two-thirds of VC funding globally in Q1\u201925\nVC investment in the Americas surged in Q1 2025, driven by a series of megadeals, while Europe saw more muted growth and Asia experienced another quarterly decline, reaching record low investment levels. Deal volume dropped across all regions, as investors remained cautious amid macroeconomic uncertainty. The US retained its position as the top destination for VC funding, bolstered by several high-profile raises, including OpenAI\u2019s $40 billion raise, Anthropic\u2019s $4.5 billion raise (two closings), and Infinite Reality\u2019s $3 billion raise in the augmented reality space. Europe ranked second in total VC investment, led by Binance\u2019s $2 billion raise \u2014 the region\u2019s largest of the quarter \u2014 followed by German proptech firm Reneo, which secured $624 million. Asia\u2019s VC market remained soft, with just three deals exceeding $500 million. Singapore-based datacentre firm DayOne led with a $1.2 billion raise, followed by China\u2019s cleantech company SE Environmental ($688 million) and India-based e-commerce platform Meesho ($550 million).\nHot AI space attracting diversity of deals across jurisdictions\nAI plays continued to dominate the VC market in Q1\u201925. While the largest deals in the AI sector occurred in the US led, by OpenAI, Anthropic and Infinite Reality, other regions also saw robust AI investments. In Europe, AI-enabled industry solutions companies raised a number of $100 million funding rounds, including Sweden-based preventative healthtech company Neko Health ($260 million) and UK-based AI-powered video communications company Synthesia ($180 million). Asia also saw a number of significant AI-focused raises, including China-based Neolix Technologies ($137 million) and Univista ($137 million), Australia-based Harrison.ai ($111 million), Hong Kong (SAR) and Boston-based InSilico Medicine ($100 million), and India-based Spotdraft ($54 million).Looking at the AI space more broadly, the launch of China-based DeepSeek\u2019s R1 AI model sent ripples across the globe in Q1\u201925. DeepSeek\u2019s launch was followed closely by new AI models by Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba. The launch of the three models so close together \u2014 all purporting to be more energy efficient than others built to date \u2014 highlights the intense competition globally and regionally for market dominance in the large language model (LLM) space.\nGeopolitical uncertainties and tensions driving VC investment into defense tech and spacetech\nAs competition heated up in the AI space worldwide, a number of governments made substantive moves in order to promote, encourage, and accelerate AI development. During the quarter, the US announced The Stargate Project, which aims to spend $500 billion on developing next gen AI infrastructure in the US.This was followed by the European Commission\u2019s announcement of its InvestAI program\u00a0\u2014 a plan to drive $206 billion into AI innovation, including the development of gigafactories \u2014 and France\u2019s announcement of $112 billion in AI investment commitments.During the quarter, China also announced a $138 billion national venture capital guidance fund to invest in a range of priority sectors, including AI and quantum computing.\nAlternative energy continues to attract interest globally\nInterest in defense tech continued to grow in Q1\u201925, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions. The US saw the largest defense tech deals during the quarter, including a $600 million raise by Saronic Technologies, a $240 million raise by ShieldAI, and a $250 million raise by Epirus. Spacetech also continued to grow on the radar of investors. Japan in particular saw several deals during the quarter, including raises by ArkEdge Space ($51 million) and Interstellar Technologies ($45 million).\nTrends to watch for in Q2\u201925\nHeading into Q2\u201925, AI is expected to remain the primary driver of VC investment globally. Industry-focused AI solutions are likely to attract growing interest, alongside advanced robotics and enabling technologies such as LIDAR. Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, sectors like defence-tech and cybersecurity are also projected to see increased VC activity.However, VC investment may begin the quarter on a slower note as investors await greater clarity on the escalating global trade war and its potential economic ramifications. Global M&A activity could accelerate in Q2\u201925 and beyond, particularly in the AI space, as major tech companies seek to acquire promising startups before valuations rise further. The recently announced $32 billion deal for Google to acquire Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz \u2014 announced prior to the U.S. administration\u2019s tariff announcements \u2014 may serve as a catalyst for increased M&A activity, particularly within the cybersecurity and broader tech sectors. In the face of continued IPO uncertainty, M&A remains a compelling alternative for companies seeking strategic exits.\nFootnotes\n1 https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/tech/openai-oracle-softbank-trump-ai-investment/index.html\n2 https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/latest/news/commission-launches-new-investai-initiative-mobilise-eu200-billion-investment-ai\n3 https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/details-110-billion-euros-investment-pledges-frances-ai-summit-2025-02-10/\n4 https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-set-up-national-venture-capital-guidance-fund-state-planner-says-2025-03-06/\nData presented correct as of April 16th 2025, and is subject to change.\nHow can KPMG in India help",

        "published_content": "Our latest Women in Energy forum considered one of the key issues facing the industry if it is to meet clean energy ambitions \u2013 workforce transformation.\nThe energy sector is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by the rising momentum of renewable energy and ambitious net-zero goals. Investment in clean energy has surged by over 40% since 2022, reflecting the industry's rapid evolution. However, this transformation also brings challenges, particularly the urgent need for talent to meet unprecedented demands. As the sector accelerates, there is an increasing imperative to build a workforce equipped with the skills necessary for the future.\nSkills gap challenge\nThis challenge is twofold. On one level, this is a question of numbers \u2013 more than 300,000 additional workers are projected to be needed in the energy sector by 2030, including roles such as 27,000 heat pump installers. However, the issue goes beyond sheer quantity. It is also crucial that the workforce has the skills needed for emerging technologies such as cybersecurity, data analytics, AI, and digital innovation across key areas including transmission engineering, carbon capture and hydrogen technology.\nJust in our area of networks, we estimate that we\u2019ll have two and a half times more work over the next five years compared to the last five. The talent need is huge. The solution is to be much more thoughtful and strategic over how we work with the supply chain. We\u2019re working more collaboratively, and this has also been helped by Ofgem through the Accelerated Strategic Transmission Infrastructure regulation and the Advanced Procurement Mechanism which mean we can start the planning processes earlier.\nAttracting and retaining diverse talent\nSimultaneously, the energy sector is in direct competition with industries such as technology and infrastructure in a real war for talent. While energy may not always compete in terms of financial rewards, it has a powerful story to tell centred on low-carbon goals and broader social purpose. But it also needs to broaden its diversity and reach further into under-represented communities.\nWe need to tear up the rulebook. There are communities that just don\u2019t know what energy has to offer in terms of a career \u2013 with so many skills that are transferable between different roles and geographies. The good news is there\u2019s a new feeling amongst a young generation who want to do something better for the planet. We need to harness that and create new entry routes for diverse talent.\nTraining and upskilling need\nAttracting new talent is vital - but so is retaining and reskilling existing staff. Upskilling current employees is arguably just as important as recruitment in addressing the skills gap.\nTraining is a massive part of it. A lot of it is about upskilling rather than new recruitment \u2013 for example, upskilling electricians to install or maintain equipment like smart meters and solar panels. Apprenticeships are also key. At Energy UK, we were very supportive of the government when it lowered the qualifications needed to get onto an apprenticeship through the Skills and Growth Levy. As an industry, we need to focus on creating tangible career pathways for 16-18 year olds, showing them what actual roles they could end up doing.\nThere is also a huge training need across the workforce in terms of digital and AI skills, building confidence at every level so that the productivity and efficiency benefits of smarter working can be realised. However, training comes with a cost.\nA consistent challenge is that many big suppliers don\u2019t directly employ much of the workforce \u2013 they contract with SMEs. As a result, they don\u2019t invest in training because they\u2019re not their people. We need to find ways around this. At Crossrail, we set up a Tunnelling Academy \u2013 and then realised that none of our trainees would ever work on Crossrail due to the timescales. We were doing it altruistically for the next generation. You\u2019ve got to balance the costs and the pay-offs.\nWorkforce planning and a skills-based approach\nArguably the key to solving the workforce challenge lies in effective workforce planning. It is essential to map out and forecast future talent needs, then develop solutions to address them. Creating a clear roadmap of the skills required is the first step toward attracting, upskilling, and retaining the talent needed for the energy transition.\nWe\u2019ve really increased our focus on this area. We started internally, forecasting our future needs and identifying the gaps, which created a powerful call to action. With strong executive sponsorship, we were then able to build the data and build the story, identifying if not exact numbers at least the direction of travel. From there, we\u2019ve been working externally with suppliers and partners to create common frameworks around critical roles. Another key factor is becoming a more skills-based organisation \u2013 that way, you have a more mobile talent base where people can transition into the roles you really need doing.\nA skills-based workforce offers enhanced flexibility and agility, enabling organisations to adapt to evolving demands. If current employees already possess 40% of the necessary skills, targeted upskilling can bridge the gap and equip them for emerging areas of development. For instance, electricians with existing expertise can be trained to install new electricity lines across the network, ensuring they contribute to the expansion and modernisation of the energy infrastructure.\nPowering the future\nWhile there is still much work to be done in meeting the workforce transformation challenge, the energy industry is rising to the occasion. Through collaboration and a focus on practical, real-world solutions, we are steadily making progress toward building the skilled workforce needed to achieve a sustainable energy future.\nOur sustainability insights",

        "published_content": "Why it is time to move on from legacy financial consolidation systems? Legacy financial systems like Oracle Hyperion, IBM Cognos Controller, or SAP BOFC have reliably supported financial management for many years. To optimize business insights and decision support, organizations must invest in modern, integrated Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) solutions. These platforms streamline operations, offer flexibility with cloud-based or on-premises deployments, and unlock new opportunities for innovation and enhanced efficiency.\nThe hidden costs and risks of legacy systems. Older EPM systems are known for their fragmented architecture. While they were once industry-leading tools, they have significant shortcomings that can disrupt business processes and drain resources. Some of the key challenges include:\nHigh maintenance and upgrade costs Maintaining older systems is expensive. These platforms require frequent updates, custom patches, and manual interventions to keep them running. Unlike modern cloud solutions, which offer automated updates and reduced infrastructure expenditures, legacy systems demand significant investment to remain functional. Moreover, keeping multiple disconnected applications coordinated demands constant attention from IT teams, further inflating costs.\nInefficient data integration Outdated systems are notorious for their lack of seamless data integration. Businesses must juggle multiple applications to handle budgeting, planning, consolidation, and reporting. This fragmentation leads to manual data transfers, increased reconciliation efforts, and a higher risk of errors. When data consolidation is labor-intensive, it delays critical insights and prevents quick decision-making, making the organization less agile. In contrast, hosted solutions provide centralized integration and real-time updates, eliminating many of these inefficiencies.\nGrowing technical debt The longer you keep a legacy system, the more technical debt you accrue. Technical debt refers to the hidden costs that arise from supporting outdated technologies, such as maintaining redundant systems, employing multiple administrators, managing complex integrations, and dealing with disaster recovery. Over time, these costs accumulate, diverting funds that could be better used for innovation and growth.\nCompliance and security concerns Older systems struggle to keep up with modern regulatory standards. When an application reaches its end-of-life, it no longer receives security updates, leaving your organization vulnerable to data breaches and compliance failures. This exposure not only risks legal penalties but can also damage your reputation with stakeholders and clients.\nNo functional improvements Most of the legacy system vendors have announced that they will no longer make strategic investments into the product leaving you with a product that is sub-optimally supporting your consolidation and reporting processes.\nHow much longer can you afford to invest in systems that cost more to maintain, limit flexibility, and will not be suitable in the future?\nThe advantages of modern, unified EPM platforms. The shortcomings of aging systems make a compelling case for upgrading to a modern financial platform. These newer solutions are designed to eliminate inefficiencies, streamline processes, and provide real-time insights that empower businesses to make strategic decisions. Key strengths of modern platforms include:\nCost efficiency through a unified solution Modern financial platforms consolidate all financial management functions - planning, budgeting, consolidation, reporting, and data quality - into one unified system. By replacing multiple disparate systems with a single platform, whether deployed on-premises or in the cloud, companies can drastically reduce the total cost of ownership. This simplification reduces the need for custom integrations, lowers administrative overhead, and eliminates the hidden IT costs associated with maintaining multiple outdated tools.\nSeamless data integration and real-time analytics A modern, integrated platform enables seamless data synchronization across all financial processes, providing a single source of truth. This real-time connectivity allows for instant access to insights, reducing the time spent on data reconciliation and manual processing. Businesses that opt for cloud-based solutions gain additional advantages, such as faster deployment, remote accessibility, and automatic updates, enabling even greater agility in decision-making.\nEnhanced security and compliance Unlike legacy systems, modern platforms are built with information safety and legal adherence at their core. Continuous updates ensure that your systems are always protected against the latest threats, and automated compliance tools help you meet regulatory standards without manual intervention. Cloud platforms offer advanced security features and frequent updates, ensuring your system remains compliant and protected against emerging risks.\nScalability and flexibility for growth Today\u2019s businesses need systems that can grow and adapt to their evolving needs. Modern platforms are scalable and flexible, enabling companies to add new features, integrate new data sources, and scale operations without overhauling their entire system.

Businesses need to proactively plan their migration to avoid disruptions, minimize costs, and ensure a smooth transition. Delaying migration can lead to costly, last-minute fixes that drain resources and cause more damage than anticipated. Instead, start by assessing your current infrastructure, identifying inefficiencies, and mapping out a clear migration roadmap.\nWhy now? Acting now to upgrade to a modern EPM platform ensures your organization is not only protected from future risks but also equipped to take advantage of new opportunities. Proactive migration allows for a structured, phased approach that minimizes downtime and aligns with your business goals.\nApproach to successful consolidation systems migration. Migrating financial systems is complex, requiring alignment of business objectives and technical requirements. Organizations that succeed often follow a structured approach like this:\nAssessment and roadmap development Begin with a comprehensive evaluation of current systems, pain points, and opportunities. Create a tailored roadmap outlining each migration phase, aligning with business goals while mitigating risks.\nTailored migration solutions Develop a migration plan customized to the organization\u2019s specific needs, whether transitioning from on-premises or web-based platforms. Apply best practices and refine approaches to ensure an efficient and smooth transition.\nIntegration and change management Ensure seamless data fusion across finance processes, incorporating data consistency, intelligent processing, and workflow improvements. Effective change management enables teams to adapt to new systems and ensures stakeholder alignment.\nPost-migration optimization After go-live, continuously monitor and optimize system performance, ensuring growth capacity, system safeguards, and alignment with evolving business needs.\nThis method transforms migration into an opportunity for enhanced efficiency and long-term growth.\nConclusion: Modernize now to secure your future. Staying with outdated financial systems is no longer a viable option. The expenses, risks, and inefficiencies are too high. Modern, unified platforms offer a clear path to cost savings, improved efficiency, and enhanced regulatory conformity. The benefits of migrating now are significant: reduced technical debt, seamless integration, and greater agility. The decision to upgrade is not just a technological one; it is a strategic move to safeguard your business\u2019s future.\nEvent: Breakfast Session Join our breakfast session From Legacy to Leading \u2013 Modernizing Consolidation Systems, hosted in collaboration with our alliance partner OneStream on 27 March 2025 from 08:30 \u2013 11:00 am CET.\nFinance Strategy & Transformation Your trusted partner for challenging and complex finance transformation journeys.",

But are financial services firms ready to unlock unprecedented growth through digital innovation?\nThis report draws upon the perspectives from 612 leaders across the financial services industry. While it reveals that the financial services sector is most likely to generate profit from its AI investments, there is also a growing need to move beyond siloed, short-sighted tactics to build a business fit for the future.\nPersistently high inflation, geopolitical pressures, regulatory challenges, and slow global economic growth are combining to challenge businesses across financial services. Interest rate volatility is dampening consumer spend and asset performance, while compliance and operational costs are steadily increasing, forcing executives to revisit growth strategies. At the same time, organizations across financial services are coming under pressure both to generate value and to operate within tighter margins.\n\n75% of financial services executives state that complex regulatory developments are the factor most heavily denting their investment confidence. The sector\u2019s inherent exposure to elevated risk and regulatory challenges has driven a need for innovation to manage these demands. While this has brought progress, the evolving risks and responsibilities continue to weigh heavily on tech decision-makers in the sector.\n92% of financial services companies are generating profits from AI. The rise of generative AI (Gen AI) is set to revolutionize financial services, enabling companies to automate complex tasks and enhance customer experiences in unprecedented ways. Financial services is the sector most likely to generate profit from its AI investments, but many organizations are still encountering problems when trying to implement AI across the business in an integrated way.\n58% of executives admit that flaws in their foundational enterprise IT systems disrupt business-as-usual on a weekly basis. Companies are increasingly looking to modernize their systems to improve resilience and remove unnecessary complexity. Across the sector, there has been an uptick in the implementation of cloud-based platforms that can help simplify digital infrastructures, with an impressive 82% of organizations prioritizing investment in XaaS in 2024.\nWhy read the report? This report is intended for CEOs, CTOs, and senior executives in the financial services industry who are looking to harness technology to help fuel operational efficiency and growth.

        "published_content": "On Tuesday 25 March 2025, Treasurer Jim Chalmers handed down the 2025\u00e2\u0080\u009326 Australian Federal Budget with updates to key economic forecasts.\nFrom personal and business tax to banking, infrastructure, health, climate change, and more, the Federal Budget has implications for every corner of the Australian economy and our position on the global stage.\nHere, KPMG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team of specialists provide unrivalled analysis following the announcement, including insights and implications across industries and businesses, with your next steps interpreted.\nThis 2025-26 Budget has been a balancing act for the government \u00e2\u0080\u0093 trying to appeal to voters before an election through personal income tax cuts and cost of living relief, while also demonstrating fiscal responsibility. While the government has committed to important new measures to provide cost of living relief, it would have been welcome to see a stronger focus on productivity and incentivising business investment.\nA surprise in the Budget is the unexpected personal income tax reductions commencing from 1 July 2026. The starting rate of income tax will reduce from the current 16 percent to 14 percent by 2027-28. This will cost an estimated $17.1 billion over the forward estimates period.\nThe Budget shows an expected deficit in the underlying cash balance for 2024-25 of $27.6 billion, or 1 percent of GDP. However, larger deficits are forecast over the remainder of the forward estimates period to 2028-29.\nFederal Government net debt is expected to remain reasonably stable as a percentage of GDP at between 21 and 24 percent over the forward estimates.\nCertain other forecasts over the forward estimates may be seen as relatively encouraging, with real GDP growth increasing to 2.75 percent and unemployment steadying at 4.25 percent.\nThe extension to the Energy Bill Relief Fund through to 31 December 2025 at a cost of $1.8 billion will be welcomed by many , as will the measures to increase the amount of Medicare bulk billing and reduce the price of medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.\nSupport for Australian manufacturing is increased through additional funding of Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s metals industry, including green iron projects and assistance for transitioning to renewable energy. There is also more than $1.8 billion for road and rail transport infrastructure over the forward estimates period as part of a $17 billion 10-year program.\nWhile the Australian Taxation Office is receiving nearly $1 billion in additional funding for compliance activities, the Budget does not signal any tax reform which may be needed to fuel Australia's future growth and to protect our competitive position globally.\nIt remains the case that the key to the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future prosperity is productivity. We are eager to hear the further announcements expected to be made as part of the election campaign and what impact they will have on this aspect of our economy.\nThis Budget is politically savvy, though economic concerns persist. The Budget serves as a launch pad for the upcoming election; sweetening existing cost-of-living relief measures, but doing so at the taxpayers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expense.\nThis Budget contains few new measures and instead refocuses existing programs in favour of production, regions and small business.\nThis is a holding budget in migration, early childhood, schools and skills pending the renegotiation of national partnership agreements. The most significant measure in higher education is the reduction of student debt.\nThe budget prioritises cost-of-living measures through energy bill relief, and adopts a no surprises approach that seeks to deliver on its existing climate and energy policy agenda.\nThe Budget provides further investment in critically needed road and rail projects to further enhance productivity and create jobs in each of the states and territories.\nThis Budget continues the government's renewed focus on improving housing supply with a focus on expanding the Help to Buy shared equity scheme.\nThis year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Budget reflects the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to tackling the impact of cost of living on health, including a range of important initiatives aimed at easing cost pressures to ensure consumers can access care when they need it.\nThis is a holding budget for immigration with the government having released its Migration Strategy in December 2023, and the subsequent introduction of multiple immigration reforms in the twelve months up to December 2024.\nThe Budget held no surprise announcements for Defence with submarine and veterans called out specifically. Overall Defence funding will rise to 2.3 percent of GDP by the early 2030s.\nIn a cost of living Budget, national security remains a priority. We are seeing funding to support border security, to reaffirm Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unequivocal commitment to Ukraine, and to Solomon Islands Police to bolster our strategic position in the region. At home, we see funding for community safety and social cohesion, strengthening the justice system and building Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resilience to natural hazards, including for impacts of Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred.\nThis Budget sees limited large-scale technology investment, with government spending focused on progressing in-flight digital transformation programs and enhancements to improve the resilience and user experience of health, human services and regulatory systems.",

KPMG, a leader in tax consulting services, offers robust solutions designed to streamline your tax strategy. In this short overview, we delve into the eight main areas of tax consulting provided by KPMG, highlighting the expertise and the value we bring to your organization.\n\nThe tax landscape is constantly evolving, influenced by regulatory changes, economic conditions, and technological advancements. Some key trends and challenges impacting the tax market include:\n\nGlobal Tax Reform\nThe impact of initiatives like BEPS 2.0 and the global minimum tax is profound. These measures aim to curb tax avoidance by multinational companies, ensuring a fairer distribution of tax revenues across countries.

Embracing these digital tools can lead to greater efficiency and transparency in financial management.\n\nCompliance and Regulatory Obligations\nCompliance refers to adhering to laws, regulations, and guidelines relevant to a particular business or industry. Ensuring compliance helps organizations avoid legal penalties, maintain their reputation, and foster trust with stakeholders. Regulatory obligations demand that companies stay updated with changes in legislation and implement necessary adjustments in their operations to remain compliant.\n\nTax Planning\nEfficient tax planning is the cornerstone of a successful financial strategy.

        "published_content": "As the digital landscape continues to evolve, cybersecurity remains a critical priority for businesses worldwide. The KPMG 2024 Global CEO Outlook reveals that CEOs now rank cybersecurity as the top business threat over the past decade, underscoring the urgency for organizations to integrate cybersecurity into their operations. The growing impact of emerging technologies also brings an increase in cyberattacks and malware, making it essential for organizations to enhance their defenses and manage cybersecurity risks effectively.\nIn Malaysia, cybersecurity is a key national priority, with the government implementing stronger regulatory enforcement, cross-ministry collaboration, and public-private partnerships to boost national cyber resilience. At the same time, the ASEAN region is intensifying its efforts to combat cyber threats, emphasizing regional cooperation to safeguard digital economies. With Malaysia and ASEAN increasing investments in digital infrastructure and accelerating data center expansion, organizations must proactively defend their operations, integrate cybersecurity, and address potential security risks.\nOur Cybersecurity Considerations 2025 report outlines eight key priorities for managing cybersecurity risks, including implementing cyber fraud prevention strategies and mitigating cyber risk exposure. As cyber threats continue to evolve, organizations that embed these considerations into their cyber defense strategies will be better positioned to thrive in an increasingly digital world.\nExplore the eight key cybersecurity considerations for 2025\n1. The ever-evolving role of the CISO\nWhat CISOs and their teams focus on, and how they interact with the rest of the organization is fluid, as the cybersecurity function becomes more broadly embedded within and better understood across the organization.\n2. The power of the people\nAs organizations continue to transform their business models in the face of new digital disruptions, many are experiencing real challenges around workload, which is exacerbating the long-discussed cyber skills gap. AI and automation can help, but there is an underlying risk of talent attrition as many teams struggle to cope.\n3. Embed trust as AI proliferates\nAI is here to stay and has a place in virtually every organizational function, but there are a number of key cyber and privacy challenges that have the potential to affect the adoption and deployment of AI.\n4. Harness AI for cyber: Racing ahead vs racing safely\nMany factors appear to be contributing to the buzz around AI adoption, from a lack of training to the fear of missing out and possibly falling behind. A key challenge is weighing the potential benefits of integrating AI into cyber and privacy functions against the potential risks.\n5. Platform consolidation: Embrace the potential but recognize the risks\nIncreasingly, many global organizations are looking to reduce the complexity and cost of their technology. Organizations that choose to do so by consolidating tools and services on to a single, or a limited number of platforms should seek to identify and navigate the inherent risks.\n6. The digital identity imperative\nAlthough there are several initiatives around digital identity sprouting up worldwide, interoperability between systems and enhanced authentication due to the emergence of deepfakes remain challenging, whether because of regulations, risk appetite, and/or public opinion regarding the processing of personal and biometric data.\n7. Smart security for smart ecosystems\nThe rise of smart devices and products worldwide is challenging and changing traditional views and approaches toward security, prompting many regulators to introduce new regimes to ensure these products meet basic security requirements.\n8. Resilience by design: Cybersecurity for businesses and society\nOrganizations should find a way, from the CISO on down, to create a broad, holistic culture of resilient security throughout their enterprise and with the aim of ensuring all stakeholders are on the same page.",

        "published_content": "The legal landscape for medium-sized and large Swiss companies is increasingly complex, marked by a variety of domestic and international challenges that demand not only meticulous attention but also sophisticated solutions. Swiss companies operate in a highly regulated environment, where compliance with local laws and international regulations is non-negotiable. This landscape is further complicated by the globalization of business operations, requiring companies to navigate through a maze of legal jurisdictions and international legal frameworks. Compliance requirements have become more stringent, as regulatory bodies intensify their oversight across industries. This includes but is not limited to, data protection laws such as revDSG, GDPR, ESG rules, anti-money laundering (AML) directives, and cross-border trade agreements, each carrying its own set of compliance stipulations. The failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant financial penalties, legal ramifications, and reputational damage. In response to these challenges, legal departments within Swiss companies are increasingly turning to legal technology (LegalTech) solutions. LegalTech provides the tools necessary to efficiently manage large volumes of legal documents, automate compliance processes, and stay updated on the latest regulatory changes. The adoption of such technology enables companies to streamline their legal operations, reduce the risk of non-compliance, and respond more adeptly to legal inquiries and issues as they arise. The quickly evolving legal and regulatory environment presents significant hurdles for Swiss companies, necessitating a proactive and technologically advanced approach to legal challenges. Legal departments must leverage LegalTech to ensure compliance, mitigate risks, and maintain operational integrity and excellence in the face of these complex legal obligations.\nUnlocking insights: addressing market trends and challenges\nNavigating the Corporate and Business Law in the Global Arena\nIn addition to the aforementioned regulatory challenges, Swiss companies must also meticulously handle matters pertaining to corporate and business law. This domain encompasses a wide range of legal issues related to the formation, governance, and operation of these entities. It includes global entity management, corporate governance principles, shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions (M&As), corporate finance, real estate and contractual agreements among others. Effective navigation through these aspects requires a deep understanding of both Swiss laws and relevant international legal standards that impact corporate operations. Corporate governance, in particular, has received increased attention in recent years, driven by a global call for greater transparency, accountability, and ethical business practices. Swiss companies are expected to adhere to rigorous governance codes, which dictate practices regarding board composition, executive compensation, and shareholder communication. Furthermore, the complexities of M&A activities, incorporating cross-border transactions, demand a highly sophisticated legal strategy to mitigate risks, ensure due diligence, and comply with antitrust regulations. The strategic importance of aligning business operations with legal requirements under corporate law cannot be overstated. It is fundamental not only to the legal safeguarding of the company but also to its long-term growth and sustainability. Thus, companies are investing in advanced legal expertise and technology to efficiently manage the multifaceted nature of corporate and business law, ensuring that they stay ahead in a competitive and legally complex environment.\n> Explore our corporate and business law services\nTailored Legal Solutions for Private Clients: Navigating Personal and Estate Law\nIn a world where individual and familial legal needs are as diverse and complex as those of corporations, tailored legal solutions for private clients stand as a pillar of comprehensive legal support.

Legal advisors play a critical role in M&A transactions, guiding companies through the labyrinthine regulatory environment and complex legal requirements that govern these activities. Legal expertise is essential in conducting due diligence, a rigorous investigation designed to unveil risks and legal obligations associated with the target entity. This process encompasses a thorough review of the company's legal standings, contracts, liabilities, compliance status, and intellectual property issues, among other pertinent factors. KPMG's legal advisory in M&As extends beyond due diligence; it involves negotiating terms, drafting and reviewing transaction documents, and ensuring adherence to corporate law and relevant regulations. Our legal advisors play a key role in structuring deals to meet clients' strategic goals while reducing legal and financial risks. For cross-border transactions, the complexity intensifies as legal teams must navigate international laws, tax considerations, and foreign regulatory requirements, necessitating a nuanced understanding of global legal frameworks and the ability to coordinate with local counsel in different jurisdictions. The role of legal advisors also entails advising on post-merger integration processes, a critical phase where legal challenges related to the consolidation of corporate entities and harmonization of operations come to the fore. Effective legal counsel helps companies achieve desired synergies without infringing on legal norms or triggering labor, antitrust, or other regulatory issues. As the corporate landscape continues to evolve with increasing regulatory scrutiny and market pressures, the demand for adept legal advisory in mergers and acquisitions has never been more pronounced. Swiss companies, in their pursuit of growth, efficiency, and competitive advantage, must lean on the strategic acumen and legal expertise of their advisors to navigate the complexities of M&As successfully. This approach not only secures legal compliance and operational integration but also safeguards the company\u2019s reputation and stakeholders' interests in the long term.\n> Explore our legal deal advisory services\nKPMG's Comprehensive Legal Services in Employment, Immigration, Rewards and Human Resources\nIn the dynamic landscape of global business, the intricacies of employment law, immigration regulations, and human resources management remain at the forefront of operational and strategic planning.

        "published_content": "In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, where technological progress continuously intersects with escalating security vulnerabilities, the imperative for advanced cyber security solutions is unparalleled.\nTo protect sensitive information against digital threats, it's important to understand new challenges and solutions. By fostering a culture of transparency and accountability, businesses can strengthen their network security and uphold ethical standards. Explore our comprehensive thought-leadership platform dedicated to discussing the nuances of cybersecurity, types of risks or risk management, as well as the intricate battleground against white-collar crime and fraud.\nStay ahead with our detailed research and expert insights on important issues impacting both businesses and individuals.\nIn keeping with KPMG\u2019s commitment to excellence, we explore the relationship between market trends and organizational resilience. Moreover, we highlight the need for robust frameworks to mitigate risk in today's digital ecosystem.\nWe analyze the complex interplay between advancing technologies and emerging threats. From the transformative potential of AI-driven cyber security solutions to the nuanced intricacies of risk management strategies. Our discourses offer clarity amid complexity.\nJoin us as we navigate the digital frontier. Use knowledge and insight to strengthen your organization's defenses against cyber risk. Embrace the opportunities of a secure, digital future.\nWith the advancement of digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity is constantly changing. This has led to a rise in complex cyber threats like ransomware and phishing attacks that are becoming more common.\nThe transition to cloud platforms by businesses, along with the quick integration of 5G networks, adds complexity to the situation. It is important to have strong security measures in place.\nIdentifying risks and creating a plan to manage them is crucial. This helps prevent data breaches and handle cyber attacks effectively. In this scenario, effective risk management is essential to protect valuable assets and information.\nAI-Driven Cybersecurity Evolution\nThe increasing influence of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity introduces new challenges.\nAI-powered cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated, leveraging machine learning algorithms to evade traditional defense mechanisms and launch highly targeted attacks. Our article \u201cHow AI influences cybersecurity\u201d shed light on utilizing AI for detecting complex threats and automating response strategies, thus revolutionizing traditional cybersecurity approaches.\nWhistleblower Protections and Triage\nThe increasing volume and complexity of whistleblowing alerts poses a significant challenge for organizations. Effectively handling and prioritizing a vast number of alerts is vital for quickly identifying and examining possible cases of misconduct.\nHowever, the sheer volume of alerts can overwhelm compliance teams, causing delays and possibly overlooking critical issues.\nImplementing efficient triage processes and leveraging technology solutions to prioritize and streamline whistleblowing alerts is essential to mitigate risks and maintain organizational integrity.\nRising figures in white-collar crimes\nData reveals an alarming increase in white-collar crimes across Switzerland, prompting a call for reinforced safeguarding measures. Financial fraud, corruption, and other white-collar crimes continue to proliferate, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage for organizations.\nAddressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach, including robust compliance programs, enhanced regulatory oversight, and effective enforcement mechanisms to deter and detect illicit activities.",

        "published_content": "Companies are facing complex challenges in a volatile market environment. Our CEO Outlook also reveals the greatest risks: disruptive technologies, geopolitics and climate change. In the face of these challenges, the ability to react in the short term is just as essential for companies as strengthening their resilience in the medium and long term.\nThis requires measures in individual areas of the company or throughout the entire organisation. A short-term increase in performance can help to provide the necessary resources for the transformations and compensate for immediate negative effects on earnings.\nKPMG supports you in the implementation with technical expertise, many years of experience and a strategic view of the big picture. This enables a timely increase in performance and a strengthening of your company's long-term resilience.\nBuild resilience and optimise performance\nRisk analysis as well as process and business model optimisation are success factors for sustainable growth. In addition, efficient preparations for unforeseeable events strengthen the company's resilience and enable adequate options for action in the event of an emergency (Prepare & Perform). KPMG's systemic approach enables companies not only to react to negative developments or crises and ensure stability (Respond), but also to realise competitive advantages by exploiting disruptive events (Respond & Outperform).\nTo optimise performance, KPMG combines the big picture and coordination (planning & PMO) with the knowledge of specialised experts, depending on the individual client challenge. Whether holistic value creation, IT cost or finance project: we are happy to be at your side.\nClimate change\nRegulatory requirements are increasing: ESG reporting will be mandatory for companies in future. A distinction must be made between natural disasters, which can, for example, directly lead to supply chain disruptions (droughts, floods, fires), and consequential effects, which include short-term increases in raw material or procurement costs. If the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement - including the 1.5-degree target - can be stringently pursued, corporate resilience and the trust of all shareholders and stakeholders can be increased - while at the same time reducing costs in the long term.\nDisruptive technologies\nThe rapid pace of digital transformation is making planning less reliable. From ensuring data security to market upheavals caused by innovations on other continents: Technological change leads to complex tasks for companies. At the same time, progress is creating new growth impulses that enable competitive advantages. Those who utilise pioneering applications at an early stage can significantly increase efficiency and tap into new markets and additional sources of income.\nSocial polarisation\nSocial media enables new forms of communication, but has also proven to be a driver of social division. The spread of so-called fake news is not only increasing due to the rapid obscuring of sources on the internet. There is less constructive discourse due to personalised digital filter bubbles. This is a complex situation for companies. In times of a polarised public, they have the option of taking a stance - even on controversial topics - and thus acting and communicating in a value-oriented manner. This commitment can become a decisive differentiating factor. Diversity in your own workforce also promotes a contemporary corporate culture and can help with employee recruitment, among other things. By individually addressing customer groups and tailoring products, services and marketing campaigns, companies can also leverage additional potential.\nMacroeconomic effects\nCompanies currently have to keep track of a wide range of economic factors. How can sales remain stable or increase in the face of volatile markets and declining purchasing power? How can operating costs be reduced without compromising on product quality? And how will interest rates develop? Questions like these need to be answered. Effective cash flow management is necessary to ensure solvency. Companies need to find a balance between short-term optimisation of cost structures and a sustainable performance strategy.\nGeopolitical risks\nGeopolitical tensions and conflicts develop extraordinary dynamics and often have cascading effects. Sanctions, trade barriers or other market access restrictions can impair supply chains that were previously functioning smoothly. Added to this is the risk of volatile exchange rates. Companies that diversify at an early stage and reduce dependencies can set themselves apart from the competition. New business relationships and gradually growing risk management expertise are crucial for resilience.\nRegulation\nMeasures that are necessary to comply with complex regulations - including the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act or the EU AI Act - are associated with increased time expenditure. This is because the laws and standards change frequently and also in terms of scope. The number of regulatory hurdles is increasing. In turn, this also means that it is more difficult for new competitors to enter the market: Those who analyse the legal implications at an early stage and proactively comply with regulatory requirements will take a leading position.\nCyber risks\nCyber criminals have new attack vectors in times of digital transformation. The number of successful attacks is increasing. Attackers are particularly focussing on the encryption of company data (ransomware). Cyber regulations, including NIS-2, the EU's Cyber Resilience Act and DORA, should help companies to be better prepared in future. Recognising cyber risks at an early stage - for example through simulations - and complying with the requirements are essential. This strengthens the defence mechanisms and at the same time the trust of customers and partners.\nDemographic change\nThe ageing of society is affecting a number of economic sectors. One aspect in focus is the shortage of skilled workers, which is already causing upheaval on the labour market. It is becoming increasingly difficult for companies to attract suitable applicants for vacancies. As a result, the global search for talent is becoming more relevant. Customers' product preferences and behavioural patterns are also changing - not least because average life expectancy continues to rise. These factors in turn open up new opportunities for companies in new market niches.",

Picasso: From the Studio, presented by the National Gallery of Ireland in collaboration with the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e national Picasso-Paris and proudly supported by KPMG Ireland, is a landmark exhibition offering visitors a unique glimpse into the private world of Picasso\u00e2\u0080\u0099s studios, where some of the most ground-breaking works of modern art were created. Running from 11 October 2025 to 22 February 2026, Picasso: From the Studio is set to be a cultural highlight of the year. This major exhibition invites visitors to step into the heart of Picasso's creative process and explore the spaces where his vision took shape.\nAbout the exhibition\nPablo Picasso (1881\u00e2\u0080\u00931973) lived surrounded by his art, with his personal life and creative process deeply intertwined. Picasso: From the Studio brings together 60 paintings, sculptures, ceramics, and works on paper, spanning over 50 years of his career. The exhibition journeys through the diverse phases, styles, and passions that defined Picasso\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, from the vibrant studios of Montmartre in the 1920\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to the sunlit interiors of his final home in Mougins. Photographic and audio-visual elements will offer an immersive glimpse into his world, offering fresh perspective on how his surroundings influenced his artistic output. Curated by Joanne Snretch, Curator of Paintings, Mus\u00c3\u00a9e national Picasso-Paris, and Janet McLean, Curator of Modern Art, National Gallery of Ireland the exhibition presents both iconic masterpieces and lesser-known works. Highlights include A Bottle and Newspaper (1913) and Violin and Bottle on a Table (1915), created in Paris, and key examples of his pioneering Synthetic Cubism. Also featured are T\u00c3\u00aate de femme (1931\u00e2\u0080\u00931932) and Portrait de Marie-Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se (1937), produced at the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Boisgeloup in Normandy, reflecting his intense relationship with Marie-Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se Walter. One of his final works, Musician (1972), created in his studio in Mougins, will also be on display, encapsulating recurring motifs from his career\u00e2\u0080\u0094guitars, musicians, and eyes\u00e2\u0080\u0094blended together in his distinctive style.\nWe are delighted to partner with KPMG Ireland for this major Picasso exhibition. Corporate sponsorships are invaluable to the Gallery, and enable us to present ambitious exhibitions. We look forward to working with KPMG to share Picasso\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creative process with audiences in Ireland and beyond.\nAt KPMG, we are committed to supporting cultural initiatives that enrich society whilst reaffirming Dublin as a great place to live and visit. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Picasso: From the Studio\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offers a rare opportunity to explore one of the most iconic artists of the 20th century in a new way, and we are proud to play a role in making this exhibition accessible to all.",

There remain concerns around the tightness of the labour market, geopolitical risks and trade barriers; meaning the RBA will remain cautious on further easing of the cash rate. Looking ahead, global and domestic economies face challenges, particularly from new US tariffs and retaliatory actions.\nAustralia emerged from a per capita recession with a 0.1% increase in GDP per capita for the quarter, despite being 0.7% lower over the year.\nHousehold spending rebounded, lifting by 0.4% after recording zero growth in the September quarter. This was driven by a mix of discretionary and essential spending, contributing 0.1 ppt each to GDP growth.\nPrivate demand contributed to GDP growth, through both household consumption (+0.2 ppt) and private investment (+0.1 ppt). This contrasts with the September quarter, where both channels were weak and did not contribute.\nPublic demand continued to support growth, comprising of government expenditure (+0.1 ppt) and public investment (+0.1 ppt) at a much less significant amount than the previous quarter, where they added 0.3 ppt and 0.4 ppt.\nGlobal growth looks weaker in 2025 and 2026. However, the global economic outlook is highly uncertain, affected by the ongoing trade war.\nGlobal economic growth is expected to slow to 2.9% in 2025 and 2.8% in 2026.\nInflation has been more persistent in certain nations, with some central banks choosing to slow down their easing cycle, while others have decided to increase rates.\nThe latest Global Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Index (PMI) indicated that the pace of global economic activity has been steady, with the index recording a value of 51.5 in February 2025, down from 52.6 recorded in December 2024.\nFull details about the Australian economic conditions and forecasts can be found in KPMG Australia's Economic and Outlook: Q1 2025.",

        "date_published": "2025-04-15",
        "published_content": "On 6 April 2025, in an overhaul of the UK consumer enforcement regime, Parts 3 and 4 of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act 2024 (DMCC) came into force. Whilst consumer laws have not fundamentally changed, the new rules have significantly increased the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s (CMA) powers, enabling it to directly enforce consumer law. The CMA can now directly determine whether consumer law breaches have occurred and impose fines of up to 10% of global turnover.\nWhilst the new consumer framework largely remains unchanged, there are some specific new prohibited practices and the CMA has increased powers to directly enforce consumer law (and so no longer needs to pursue infringement through the courts). Based on its initial guidance on approach to consumer protection (published 7 April 2025) (the Guidance), the CMA plans to target aggressive sales practices, hidden fees, fake reviews and practices relating to subscription contracts (which are covered by the new prohibitions). Based on continuing regulatory focus across UK and Europe, we also expect the CMA to target misleading green claims and harmful online choice architecture.\nIn this article, we set out a summary of the CMA\u2019s new rules, where enforcement is anticipated and how businesses can prepare.\nCMA\u2019s new direct enforcement powers \nPreviously, the CMA\u2019s consumer protection powers were primarily governed by the Enterprise Act 2002 which gave the CMA powers to investigate breaches of consumer law, agree undertakings with businesses to remedy the suspected breaches, and apply to courts to enforce such undertakings. With its new powers, the CMA can directly decide whether consumer protection laws have been infringed, order redress to customers, and sanction businesses that do not comply. In particular, the CMA will be able to (inter alia):\nIssue provisional infringement notices: After starting an investigation, the CMA can issue a \"provisional infringement notice\" (PIN), requiring a trader to stop infringing consumer protection law.\nImpose penalties: The CMA can issue a \u201cfinancial infringement notice\u201d requiring companies to pay a fine of up to \u00a3300,000 or 10% of the enforcement target\u2019s turnover. Further fines can be imposed for ongoing noncompliance (\u00a3150,000 or 5% of turnover and further daily fines). Fines can also be imposed for withholding or providing misleading or false information.\nAccept undertakings: The CMA can accept undertakings (instead of imposing an infringement notice) and enforce a breach of those undertakings by imposing fines (up to \u00a3150,000 or, if higher, 10% of the enforcement target\u2019s turnover). The CMA can also require traders to compensate consumers and take other remedial steps.\nClaim substantiation: The CMA can require traders to produce evidence as to the accuracy of factual claims (the burden of proof for accuracy of sales and marketing sits with traders).\nProhibition on reviews and drip pricing \nAs well as the new enforcement powers, the DMCC also introduces new banned practices by adding to the list of already defined specific unfair commercial practices. The newly introduced banned practices include:\nFake and misleading reviews\nThe practice of submitting or commissioning fake reviews or not revealing that a review was paid for or incentivised in any other way. In its Guidance, the CMA has confirmed that until July 2025, it will help businesses focus on compliance with new rules (rather than sanctioning non-compliance).\nDrip pricing\nThe practice of displaying only part of an item\u2019s price during the early stages of the consumer journey and then uncovering further mandatory elements of the price later in the sales journey when the consumer may already feel committed to buying the item. The CMA has confirmed that pending further guidance, they will only take action against genuinely unexpected and untrailed mandatory charges added at the end of a purchasing journey.\nNew rules for subscription contracts \nThe DMCC also provides new rules around subscription contracts (albeit it is not anticipated that these rules will come into force until Spring 2026). Under the new rules, traders will need to:\ngive consumers extended pre-contract information about a subscription and confirm it on a durable medium post-contract;\nsend consumers renewal reminders at specified intervals;\ngive consumers cooling off rights on entry into the contract, expiry of any introductory period and on any renewal which commits the consumer to a further period of 12 months or more. Traders must alert consumers to their rights by sending them cooling-off notices;\nprovide easy mechanisms for termination; and\ngive consumers an \"end of contract notice\" on termination.\nGreen claims\nMisleading product or service claims such as presenting goods as environmentally friendly or sustainable without adequate evidence, are expected to continue to attract regulatory attention. While the DMCC does not contain specific provisions on greenwashing, false or misleading claims about green credentials could fall in scope of the rules.This has been a significant target of the CMA in recent years. For example:\nIn March 2024, the CMA obtained undertakings from three fashion labels in relation to their Green Claim practices, including:\nGreen Claims: Companies must ensure all green claims are accurate, supported by appropriate evidence and not misleading. Key information should be clear, easy to read, and prominently displayed for shoppers.\nStatements About Fabrics: Claims about materials (e.g., 'organic' or 'recycled') should be specific and clear. Ambiguous terms like 'eco,' 'responsible,' or 'sustainable' need further explanation. The percentage of recycled or organic fibres must be clearly visible.\nCriteria for Green Ranges: The criteria for including products in environmental collections must be clearly outlined, including any minimum requirements (e.g., percentage of recycled fibres). Products cannot be marketed as part of an environmental range unless they meet these criteria.\nUse of Imagery: Companies must not use misleading imagery (e.g., green leaves) or logos that imply a product is more environmentally friendly than it truly is.\nProduct Filters: Search filters must be accurate and show only items that meet the filter's criteria (e.g., only recycled products should be shown under a 'recycled' filter).\nEnvironmental Targets: Claims about environmental targets must be supported by a clear, verifiable strategy. Consumers should have access to details on the target, its expected completion date, and the approach to achieving it.\nAccreditation Schemes: Statements about accreditation schemes must be clear and not misleading, specifying whether the accreditation applies to specific products or the company\u2019s overall practices.\nIn December 2023, the CMA opened an investigation into a producer of household items, including cleaning products and toiletries. Specific concerns related to statements and claims that were vague and potentially misleading, exaggerations about how natural a product is, recyclability of a product, and use of imagery (e.g., green leaves indicating a product is more environmentally friendly than it actually is).\nIn April 2025, the ASA cleared an energy company and a financial services firm of allegations of greenwashing, confirming that their advertisements marketing green initiatives did not breach advertising rules. The ruling in respect of the energy company has been heavily criticised by one of the complainants, who said that \u201cwith this ruling the ASA is essentially endorsing greenwash\u201d demonstrating how even rulings in favour of companies in relation to green claims can still cause damage to corporate reputation. However, the ASA has upheld complaints challenging the advertisements of another energy giant as misleading because they omitted material information about the overall environmental impact of the company\u2019s business activities, specifically its contribution to harmful emissions. It has ordered that the advertisement must not appear again in the form complained of.\nThe CMA has also issued a \u201cGreen Claims Code\u201d to provide guidance on what is and is not acceptable under existing competition and consumer protection rules. In April 2025, the CMA published its Unfair Commercial Practices Guidance which includes examples of greenwashing.\nGuidance issued by the CMA\nThe CMA has issued Guidance to ensure businesses have sufficient clarity around the implementation of the DMCC. It sets out the likely priority areas of enforcement and compliance activity, the CMA\u2019s improvements to consumer protection work, and what stakeholders can expect in the first year under DMCC:\nAreas of focus for investigation\nThe CMA expects to focus early action on aggressive sales practices that prey on vulnerable customers as well as practices of providing customers with information that is objectively false. The CMA also intends to prioritise early action on the new banned practices including fake reviews and clearly imbalanced and unfair contract terms that impose unfair exit charges on customers.\nApproach to new provisions on fake reviews and drip pricing\nThe DMCC, apart from introducing these new banned practices, also imposes a duty on anyone who publishes/reviews information to take effective steps to prevent and remove from publication fake and concealed incentivised reviews and fake or misleading information. There is more information in the CMA\u2019s specific Fake Reviews Guidance.\nPenalties during the first 12 months\nStakeholders can expect the CMA to focus on ensuring harmful conduct is stopped and that consumers are compensated. Even though penalties can only be imposed on businesses that are in breach following the commencement of DMCC, the CMA may have regard to any aggravating or mitigating factors that occurred prior to DMCC coming into force.\nCollaboration with other UK regulators and enforcement bodies\nThe CMA will continue to share its consumer enforcement powers with other enforcers such as Trading Standards and sector regulators. The CMA will also engage in forums such as the Consumer Protection Partnership and the Consumer Concurrency Group to ensure intelligence is shared promptly between enforcing bodies, the enforcer is best placed to act, and action by enforcers is coordinated to prevent unnecessary burdens on businesses.\nCollaboration with other EU regulators\nRegulators across UK and EU have been collaborating on consumer protection and this will continue. Businesses should keep an eye on the enforcement activity across the EU to spot future areas of focus for the CMA.\nHow can businesses prepare?\nThe changes imposed by the DMCC are far reaching and create exposure for businesses on multiple fronts. To identify exposure risks, businesses should review their current practices to identify exposure in relation to drip pricing, consumer reviews and subscription contracts, as well as consider possible risks from advertising or marketing practices, particularly in relation to potential \u2018greenwashing\u2019. In brief:\nConduct a review of current practices \nIdentify exposure to drip pricing, consumer reviews, or subscription contracts. Contact your marketing teams to confirm what (if any) claims the business is making and whether any of these cannot be substantiated. Note that the CMA will be able to receive complaints and as such, disgruntled consumers and competitors can make reports to the CMA directly.\nChanges to processes\nOnce any practices have been identified that create risk exposure, consider updating protocols to ensure compliance issues are resolved. The CMA\u2019s guidance makes it clear that proactive and meaningful steps in good faith to correct infringing conduct will be considered when considering issuing any penalties.\nTraining\nEnsure your marketing and commercial teams are trained on the various aspects of the DMCC and how to mitigate risks.\nPreparation for investigation\nEnsure staff are properly trained on how to act if your business is subject to a regulatory investigation or a dawn raid.\nContact us\nPlease contact our KPMG Law team for further details:\nLisa Navarro\nAnnalie Grogan\nAmanda Coale\nAntoni Wasilewski",

        "published_content": "Corporate misconduct, such as fraud or harassment, is a major challenge for companies in Switzerland. Approximately 20% of them report losses of more than EUR 10,000 per year due to employee misconduct. This can result in financial loss, legal complications, and reputational damage, as well as damaging relationships with customers, investors, and employees.\nYou need to address these issues to ensure business continuity, comply with Swiss legal requirements, and protect your company's reputation. Proactively managing misconduct not only reduces financial losses but also helps to create a productive and trustworthy work environment.\nAt KPMG Switzerland, we offer a full range of forensic review services to address various types of corporate misconduct. With a strong track record in forensic services, risk management, and compliance, KPMG can help identify and address potential misconduct before it escalates.\nLegal responsibilities of Swiss employers\nSwiss employment law requires employers to investigate any allegations that may violate an individual's rights. This underlines the need for thorough and fair investigations. \nThese are essential to comply with the law and maintain ethical standards in accordance with Swiss regulations. Fulfilling these legal obligations will help avoid potential legal problems for the company.\nChallenges of internal investigations\nInternal investigations can be faster and more cost-effective, but they come with challenges:\nLimited resources: the HR team may not have the right skills or tools to conduct a full investigation. This can lead to details being overlooked.\nPerceived bias: employees may perceive bias in internal investigations. This is especially true if the team has a close relationship with those being investigated.\nBenefits of hiring outside forensic experts\nThere are several benefits to hiring outside forensic experts:\nImpartiality\nExternal experts provide an unbiased perspective, making their findings reliable and free from internal factors or bias.\nSpecialized expertise\nOutside investigators have the forensic science skills needed for complex cases. They ensure thorough evidence gathering.\nCompliance with Swiss laws and regulations\nThey are familiar with local laws and ensure that investigations comply with Swiss legal standards. This reduces the risk of legal issues.\nCriminal investigations\nExternal experts are able to handle criminal investigations, providing support in cases that may involve serious violations of the law.\nCase study\nSuccessful external investigation\nA Swiss company facing allegations of financial fraud hired external forensic experts.\nWhile investigating, the experts identified the perpetrators and helped the company take legal action.\nThis restored trust with stakeholders and demonstrated the company's commitment to ethical behavior.\nCorporate culture and fraud prevention\nA strong corporate culture helps prevent fraud. Swiss companies should focus on:\nTransparency: establish clear lines of communication and investigative reporting channels for witness statements.\nAccountability: hold all employees, including managers, accountable for any fraudulent activity and take appropriate disciplinary action when necessary.\nEthics training: regularly train everyone in the work environment on company values and ethical standards.\nA strong ethical foundation reduces misconduct cases and builds trust among employees. This enhances the company's reputation and supports long-term success.\nLegal compliance in investigations\nSwiss companies must comply with strict statutory and legal requirements when conducting employee investigations. Key factors in ensuring investigation compliance include:\nData privacy: ensure compliance with data protection laws such as the Federal Act on Data Protection and/or the EU's GDPR.\nEmployee rights: respect employee privacy and rights during investigations.\nDocumentation: maintain clear, accurate records to support any legal action.\nCompanies need to work closely with legal counsel to ensure that the investigation meets legal standards. This will help avoid risks and penalties.\nThe role of investigation management tools\nTechnology really improves the entire process, with an investigative case management system helping companies with:\nTracking progress: track every step of the examination.\nImproving collaboration: improve the communication between all parties involved.\nMaintaining records: securely store evidence for future use.\nThese tools increase efficiency and create a more organized approach to examinations. They minimize human error and speed up the process.\nFraud management plan and ongoing strategies\nA strong fraud management plan is critical to maintaining long-term integrity. Key strategies include:\nWhistleblower mechanisms: provide secure and anonymous ways for employees to report unethical behavior.\nContinuous auditing: regularly review processes and transactions to identify problems early.\nFraud risk assessments: regularly assess risks to prevent problems before they occur.\nBy taking these steps, such as hiring a fraud investigator, Swiss companies can reduce the risk of misconduct. This strengthens their commitment to ethics and ensures long-term sustainability.\nDeveloping a proactive misconduct detection system\nSwiss companies can strengthen their corporate culture and reduce misconduct by implementing a proactive detection system. Key steps include:\nMonitoring tools\nUse audits and data analytics to identify potential misconduct early.\nBehavioral reviews\nRegularly assess employee behavior to identify red flags.\nClear reporting systems\nEstablish easy and confidential channels for employees to report unethical behavior.\nEmployee training\nEducate employees about ethical standards and the importance of reporting misconduct.\nA proactive misconduct detection system reduces risk, protects company assets and fosters a transparent and ethical work environment. This enhances the company's credibility.\nIntegrating external investigations with KPMG services\nAt KPMG Switzerland, we offer a full range of forensic review services to address various types of corporate misconduct. Our approach includes:\nFraud risk management: develop strategies to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and misconduct.\nForensic technology: use advanced tools to analyze real-time data and gather evidence.\nRegulatory compliance: ensure that investigations comply with local regulatory requirements to reduce the risk of penalties.\nGlobal investigations: support cross-border investigations by leveraging our international network and expertise.\nLeveraging digital forensics\nDigital forensic techniques have become an integral part of modern inquiries and are critical to solving complex fraud cases. They include recovering deleted emails, tracing unauthorized access, and analyzing crime scenes \u2013 both physical and digital. \nKPMG's forensic experts specialize in uncovering evidence in virtual environments, ensuring thorough and credible investigations that are tailored to the Swiss market.\nHuman Resources investigations and internal fraud prevention\nHuman Resources (HR) investigation processes are key to combating internal fraud and employee misconduct. \nThese investigations ensure compliance with company policies and Swiss legal standards, while protecting employee rights. By incorporating anti-fraud policies and regular training, HR professionals can help foster a culture that emphasizes ethical behavior and discourages misconduct. \nIn addition, HR teams play an integral role in identifying and addressing potential risks before they escalate.\nBuilding a fraud-resilient organization\nCorporate investigations uncover misconduct that can damage an organization's success and reputation. External forensic expertise and fraud management strategies help Swiss companies protect their operations and build a culture of integrity. \nFor more relevant information on how KPMG Switzerland can help with forensic investigations and misconduct prevention, please visit our Forensic consulting page.",

        "published_content": "The complexities of modern deal-making \u2014 whether involving mergers, acquisitions, or other significant financial transactions \u2014 demand a strategic and informed approach.\nCompanies today are navigating a landscape marked by rapid technological advancements, evolving regulatory environments, and shifting economic conditions. The rise of digital transformation has redefined traditional deal processes, while the growing importance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria is reshaping investment strategies and decision-making frameworks.\nMoreover, the integration of IT systems, the management of data, and the careful consideration of cost structures have become essential elements in executing successful transactions. Each deal brings its own set of challenges, from identifying the right targets and conducting thorough due diligence to ensuring seamless post-merger integration. Organizations must remain agile and well-informed to capitalize on opportunities, mitigate risks, and drive sustainable growth.\nThis page serves as your comprehensive resource, providing the latest insights into market trends, addressing common challenges, and showcasing the expertise necessary to navigate the multifaceted world of deals. Whether you are looking to understand the impact of new technologies, explore the implications of ESG, or gain sector-specific insights, you'll find valuable information to guide your strategy and decision-making processes.\nUnlocking insights: addressing market trends and challenges\nThe deals landscape is continuously evolving, influenced by emerging trends and the unique challenges they present. Below, we explore some of the most critical market trends and challenges that companies face today, providing insights and linking to relevant resources for deeper exploration.\nDigital Transformation and its impact on deals\nDigital transformation is fundamentally altering how deals are approached, executed, and integrated. Advanced technologies and data analytics are enabling companies to streamline due diligence processes, identify synergies more efficiently, and mitigate risks.\nThe digitalization of the deal-making process allows for greater transparency, faster decision-making, and enhanced value creation. Companies that embrace digital tools are better positioned to unlock hidden opportunities and drive successful outcomes in their transactions.\nThe growing importance of ESG in deal-making\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors have become increasingly critical in deal-making. Investors and businesses alike are prioritizing sustainable and ethical practices, recognizing that these elements are not only beneficial for society but also drive long-term value.\nESG considerations now play a central role in due diligence, influencing deal terms, valuations, and the overall attractiveness of a transaction. Companies that fail to address ESG risks may face reputational damage, regulatory penalties, and diminished investor confidence.\nManaging IT as a key asset in mergers and acquisitions\nIT is a critical yet often underestimated component in the success of mergers and acquisitions. The integration of IT systems can make or break a deal, as incompatible or insecure systems can lead to significant operational disruptions.\nMoreover, with the increasing prevalence of cyber threats, ensuring the robustness and security of IT infrastructure is paramount. Effective management of IT assets during M&A can lead to smoother integrations, reduced risks, and the preservation of value.\nCost of Capital: a crucial consideration in deal execution\nDetermining the cost of capital is a fundamental aspect of any deal, influencing valuation, financing decisions, and overall strategy.\nAccurately assessing the cost of capital is vital for ensuring that a deal is financially viable and strategically sound. It affects everything from the initial valuation of the target company to the final negotiation of deal terms. Misjudging the cost of capital can lead to overpaying, underestimating risks, or failing to achieve the desired return on investment.\nSector-specific insights: tailoring strategies for success\nDifferent industries present unique challenges and opportunities in the context of deals. Whether it\u2019s the highly regulated life sciences sector or the dynamic banking industry, tailored strategies are essential to address the specific nuances of each industry.\n Sector-specific knowledge and expertise are crucial for identifying the right targets, navigating regulatory requirements, and maximizing value.

Businesses that prepare and adapt to these changes are best positioned to thrive.\nKPMG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new global report \u00e2\u0080\u0098Top Geopolitical Risks 2025\u00e2\u0080\u0099 outlines five critical trends that Kiwi businesses should consider:\nTectonic geopolitical shifts in power, wealth, and trade\nA complex, fragmented regulatory environment\nSteering a path through the technology maze\nResilience in an unpredictable world\nShaping a dynamic and adaptable workforce\nBy proactively managing these geopolitical risks, Kiwi businesses can not only mitigate potential threats but also take advantage of new opportunities for growth and stability.\nThe below report details insights from KPMG leaders across the world on the top geopolitical risks of 2025 and identifies how to turn these challenges into opportunities.\nIn our report, we have identified five critical trends:\nNew trade alliances and investment hubs are redefining global power dynamics. The US is imposing tariffs, eliciting retaliatory responses, while new economic \u00e2\u0080\u0098nodes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 are emerging outside of traditional investment centres.\nRegulations and tax are evolving at different speeds in different geographies. Minimum global tax is becoming adopted by many countries, while others are withdrawing from multilateral tax policy.\nShifting alliances (based upon national security concerns) and fragmented regulations add to complexity, while the emergence of new Generative AI (Gen AI) players challenges US dominance. Regulators are struggling to keep pace with new Gen AI solutions, and a rolling back of regulations could leave AI models out of control. Geopolitical competition in AI and other technologies (i.e. quantum computing) is creating technological blocs around the US and China, thus jeopardising international cooperation and access.\nGeopolitical rivalries, trade protectionism, conflict, competition for resources, cyberattacks and climate events place severe strains on globally exposed businesses. Wars and tensions pose rising threats to key shipping choke points. Countries are adopting protectionist measures to safeguard and diversify their supply chains, including energy, food and critical minerals.\nAging populations, mass retirement, falling birth rates (in developed markets), changing worker preferences, culture wars, AI integration and reskilling bring major workforce challenges.",

        "published_content": "Leading organisations are moving away from rigid, prescriptive controls; today's dynamic markets and complex macroeconomic landscape demands a more agile and risk-based approach. This shift presents an opportunity for banks to move beyond a compliance-driven mindset to embrace a culture of controls that prioritises efficiency, effectiveness, and proactive risk management.\nFrom Prescriptive to Outcome-Based: A New Era of Risk and Controls\nRegulation has traditionally been regarded as prescriptive, outlining specific requirements that banks must implement. While this approach provides a clear framework of rules for banks to comply with, it often creates a \u201ctick-the-box\u201d mentality. The result is then layering of manual control upon manual control to meet a disparate set of regulatory requirements.\nBut the regulatory landscape is shifting towards a more outcome-based approach, empowering banks to design controls that fit their unique risk profiles and business models. This requires a cultural shift, a need for organisations to make judgment calls to figure out the most effective way to protect the bank. As with any cultural shift, it requires people to think and behave differently\nDefining a Culture of Controls\nA strong culture of controls across all levels of the organisation is needed to thrive in this environment. It requires a shared mindset and commitment, where all colleagues clearly understand how their role contributes to safeguarding the bank and enabling sustainable growth in line with the bank's risk appetite.\nA strong culture of controls is characterised by:\nGoing beyond compliance\nColleagues regard controls as essential to achieving business objectives safely and sustainably.\nEscalating early\nColleagues identify and raise potential risks or control failures early and healthy challenge is encouraged.\nShared responsibility\nEffective risk and control management is regarded as a shared responsibility across all lines of defence.\nRead-across\nLessons learned from past incidents and near misses are shared to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\nThe Drivers of a Culture of Controls\nBuilding a culture of controls requires an approach that focuses on people, training, governance, and communication. By focusing on these key drivers, organisations can effectively steer their culture in the right direction:\nTone from the top and middle\nRole modelling and setting the tone from the top, encouraging\u202fopen and transparent communication and empowering individuals to take ownership of risk management.\nTraining\nEquip employees with the knowledge, skills and tools necessary to design, implement, operate and monitor controls effectively.\nGovernance\nEstablish clear governance structures, ensuring accessible and well-enforced policies and accountability control frameworks.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nClear and structured reporting lines, enabling conducive cultural dynamics and accountability for controls across all LODs.\nThe Cost-Benefit Equation: Investing in a Culture of Controls\nEmbedding a culture of controls requires an upfront investment in training, resources, and technology, but the long-term benefits outweigh the costs.\nMaximising process coverage (control to process ratio)\nEnhancing efficient risk mitigation across key processes.\nReduced manual intervention\nMinimising manual controls, which are prone to human error and inefficiencies, and leveraging technology-enabled solutions.\nSpending less time fixing, more time preventing\nShifting employee focus from reactive problem-solving to proactive risk identification and mitigation.\nEmbracing a culture of controls is a necessity, not a nice-to-have that requires commitment from stakeholders at all levels. Get it right and unlock a proportionate approach that drives safe, sustainable growth.",

        "published_content": "Amidst rising competition, stricter regulations, and sustainability challenges, businesses are expecting more from their Corporate Services. To understand how they are meeting these demands, KPMG surveyed 250 senior executives spanning multiple industries and functions, from front office roles to the C-suite and beyond.\nCorporate services defined\nFront office: Customer support operations, product development, and marketing/sales functions.\nMiddle office: Research and development, risk and regulatory compliance, and quality assurance.\nBack office: HR, legal/risk, procurement, supply chain/logistics, IT, and finance.\nAligning to deliver value\nThe survey revealed that value is a major concern for executives, with fewer than one-third believing Corporate Services provide high-quality services. Misalignment between business strategy and operating models is a significant issue, as 73 percent report only \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoderate alignment\u00e2\u0080\u009d between the goals of their function and those of the overall organization.\nOver 1/2 say their function's priorities are only \"somewhat\" aligned with those of the wider organization.\n4 out of 10 say their Corporate Services functions are siloed.\nHalf of key leaders including CEOs, chief strategy and, transformation officers, would reorganize Corporate Services to improve the delivery of services and value.\nNearly half of respondents point to unaligned goals as the main challenge in connecting back-office and other organizational units. Corporate Services often struggle with common data, processes, and practices, but technology now demands closer collaboration among functions for better service quality. This may require substantial changes for some organizations.\nCorporate Services often fail to drive value due to operating in functional silos and misalignment with the organization's strategy. To maximize potential, they need interconnectivity and collaboration for better efficiency and agility.\nChris J. Moore\nPartner and National Service Line Leader, Finance Transformation\nKPMG in Canada\nEmbracing Gen AI\nNot surprisingly, our survey shows that the top external factor driving Corporate Services transformation is rapidly advancing technology (23 percent). Businesses must also embrace the fact that generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) will eventually replace some business processes and capabilities currently performed by people.\nCompanies must rethink roles to leverage talent and automation, ensuring a collaborative Gen AI adoption approach for processes spanning multiple functions.\nSometimes, a reorganization is needed to enhance Corporate Services. Improvements focusing solely on internal processes, systems, and data might not suffice.\nChris J. Moore\nPartner and National Service Line Leader, Finance Transformation\nKPMG in Canada\nIn summary\nCorporate Services may not need a complete overhaul but rather fine-tuning. Leaders must balance stability and disruption to deliver essential services while evolving. This Global report explores how companies can enhance Corporate Services by addressing four strategic imperatives affecting productivity, structure, and culture:\nFocus on enterprise value \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and design Corporate Services to support value creation.\nHarness the power of data to deliver more value for the business.\nEmbrace Gen AI to fundamentally change Corporate Services including the workforce.\nIncentivize and enable change to advance Corporate Services.\nBy embracing these advancements and strategically integrating Gen AI, companies can unlock new levels of efficiency and innovation. The key lies in fostering a culture that embraces change while maintaining core values, ensuring that both employees and technology work synergistically towards common goals.",

It aims to balance economic prosperity, with social equity and environmental preservation (in line with the triple bottom line approach: people, planet, and profit).\nE, S, and G (namely Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria are now fundamental for both corporate strategy and investment. These represent a key shift in the economy and everyday decision-making. All stakeholders are increasingly recognizing that ESG principles help maintain and create value, overcoming short-term complexities and allowing for improved long-term planning.\nCompanies, investors and consumers are focusing more on the value of corporate social responsibility (CSR), recognizing the positive impacts the private and public sectors can deliver by operating in an ethical manner.\nESG is therefore shifting from managing risks to creating new value. Embracing sustainable growth is key to building strong and resilient businesses.\nBy working together, we can positively impact the planet and society, supporting this crucial transformation towards a more sustainable future.\nCompanies face many environmental, social, and governance (ESG) trends and challenges in today's fast-changing business world.\nIdentifying them helps businesses meet stakeholder expectations, while supporting sustainable growth and increasing resilience in a competitive market.\nRegulators and investors around the world are recognizing how material these impacts are, and require corporates to increasingly identify, assess and disclose both their impacts on the environment and society (impact materiality), and the environmental and socials risks and dependencies which might affect their financial performance and operations (financial materiality).\nBy integrating environmental responsibility, fostering social equity, and upholding strong governance, businesses can create a resilient and future-ready organization. Addressing climate risks, promoting inclusive workplaces, and ensuring ethical leadership are no longer optional \u2014 they are essential for long-term success.\nCompanies that embed sustainable finance, circular economy principles, and transparent ESG reporting into their core strategies will not only meet regulatory expectations but also drive innovation, strengthen stakeholder trust, and secure competitive advantages.\nSustainability is not just about compliance \u2014 it\u2019s about creating lasting value for businesses, society, and the planet.\nIn 2015, the United Nations created 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals aim to support social, economic, and environmental sustainability by 2030 for all UN member countries.\nThe 17 goals focus on the most urgent challenges of our time and provide politicians with a framework for action. The SDGs provide companies with a basis for setting their corporate strategy.\nThe Swiss Federal Council outlined the political implementation of the SDGs in Switzerland. This is part of its sustainability development strategy for 2023 (2033 SDS).\nThis strategy created guidelines for future federal policy. It set goals for 2030 and outlined domestic and foreign priorities, each with its own political focus.\nThus, companies can already get an idea of what to expect in these areas and make corresponding adjustments.\nNo matter where you are in your sustainability journey, we can help you find long-term benefits for your business.\nOur ESG services aim to do more than just strategy. They are a key part of a client\u2019s ESG transformation, risk, tax, advisory, reporting, and assurance needs.\nWith top industry experience, data-driven technology, and global partnerships, you can turn insights into opportunities.

        "published_content": "On 3 April, President Trump announced a series of tariff measures on the import of goods into the US.\nThe announcement was followed by an Executive Order which results in:\nGoods imported from all countries into the US from 5 April 2025 will be subject to a baseline tariff of 10%.\nFor selected territories including the EU, higher \u00e2\u0080\u009cReciprocal tariff\u00e2\u0080\u009d rates will apply from 9 April onwards.\nA chart of selected countries and tariff rates is set out below.\nIt should be noted that the baseline tariff of 10% is in addition to the normal duty rate that applies to the import of goods into the US today.\nWhilst the wording on the Reciprocal Tariffs is less clear, we are operating on the basis such tariffs will also be in addition to normal duty rates.\nThe baseline tariff and Reciprocal Tariff rates become effective on 5 April and 9 April respectively.\nAll goods of EU origin (including goods of Irish origin) will be subject to these additional tariffs unless falling under an exclusion.\nThere are limited exclusions but importantly for Ireland pharmaceutical products are currently exempted from these additional tariffs.\nIt is important to be aware the tariffs are based on the country of origin (not the country of dispatch) and the value. There are rules for determining origin and this is generally based on country of production/last significant transformation and not country of dispatch.\nFor example, goods made in China shipped to the US from the EU are of Chinese Origin and subject to Chinese reciprocal tariffs (of 34%) not EU reciprocal tariffs (of 20%).\nThe baseline tariff and Reciprocal Tariff rates do not apply to certain categories of goods, being:\nPharmaceuticals, semi-conductors, lumber, copper, certain critical minerals and energy and energy products\nCompliant goods under the USMCA free trade agreement between Mexico, Canada and the United States (noncompliant goods are subject to a 25% rate).\nSteel and aluminium, and derivatives thereof which are subject to additional tariffs of 25% imposed on 12 March 2025\nMotor vehicles and parts thereof \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on 26 March President Trump issued an Executive Order applying a 25% tariff to motor vehicles effective 3 April, which was confirmed 2 April and now in effect, and certain motor vehicle parts (engines and engine parts, transmissions, powertrain parts and electrical components) on 3 May\nThe EU is expected to make an announcement on Friday 4 April. It is likely that, at a minimum, the countermeasures the EU were due to implement on 1 April but later postponed will come into effect on or after 15 April. The EU countermeasures will result in the EU imposing tariffs on a range of imports including Harley- Davidson motorbikes, bourbon, orange juice, jeans, steel and aluminium and impact approximately \u00e2\u0082\u00ac6billion of imports from the US.\nThe EU has also undertaken a consultation to identify a further \u00e2\u0082\u00ac18billion of other US products which could be made subject to new EU tariffs. The proposed targeted products include a mixture of industrial and agricultural products (steel and aluminium products, textiles, leather goods, home appliances, house tools, plastics, wood products, poultry, beef, certain seafood, nuts, eggs, dairy, sugar and vegetables).\nGiven the high Reciprocal Tariff rate applied by the US to EU origin goods, it is likely that further measures will be introduced by the EU.\nThe US has signalled that President Trump also may increase the US tariff if trading partners retaliate or decrease the tariffs if trading partners take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align with the United States on economic and national security matters.\nHow that will be interpreted by the EU is yet to be seen, but we expect the EU will as a first step apply a range of tariff countermeasures followed by efforts to negotiate an agreed position with the US, with the threat of additional tariff and non-tariff measures to be applied in the event no agreement is reached.\n In this context, Commission President Von Der Leyen has urged negotiations and commented that \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are already finalising a first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel. And we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail,\".\nNotably pharmaceuticals were not included in the announcement.\nHowever, there is speculation that the sector is being closely examined by the Trump administration and may be targeted by additional US tariff measures in the future.\nProducts of origin in Northern Ireland should be subject to 10% reciprocal tariffs applying to the United Kingdom and not 20% presenting a lower tariff cost for product of Northern Ireland origin shipped to the US.\nThe imposition of additional retaliatory tariffs on products of US origin by the EU is likely to complicate the importation process for goods into Northern Ireland from the US. Under the terms of the Windsor Framework this would likely cause the EU tariff rate to apply to US products (as they would be automatically considered \u00e2\u0080\u0098at risk\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of moving to the EU), regardless of whether they are for the UK market.\nIf the goods remain in the UK and this can be evidenced it is possible for the difference between the EU tariff paid and the UK tariff to be reclaimed from the UK under the tariff reimbursement scheme, however, this can be a time-consuming process with a high evidential burden.\nFor Irish and EU businesses, these developments necessitate a strategic approach to mitigate potential disruptions. Here are some key considerations:\n1. Understand the origin and classification of your goods and your valuation methodology\nEnsure you fully understand the origin and classification of goods you sell to the US and the possible tariffs that may apply. This should be clear for products wholly produced in Ireland but may be less clear for products imported into Ireland including from Northern Ireland or which comprise substantial parts imported from other countries.\nA similar exercise should be carried out for goods imported from the US to understand if your imports may become subjected to additional EU tariffs which are imminent.\nImportantly, and unlike the US measures, it is likely the EU countermeasures will be targeted and product specific and there is not expected to be a blanket tariff applied to all products of US origin.\nThe customs methodology for valuation of your supplies is also relevant (e.g. transfer pricing methodology).\n2. Assess supply chains\nEvaluate your supply chains to identify dependencies on US imports and exports. Diversifying suppliers and where possible exploring alternative markets can help reduce vulnerability to tariff impacts.\n3. Cost Management\nAnticipate increased costs due to tariffs and develop strategies to manage these expenses.\n4. Explore customs procedures and other mitigation opportunities.\nDepending on your supply chain and operations in Ireland/the EU, there may be benefit in availing of special customs procedures such as Customs Warehousing, and Inward Processing Relief in the EU to mitigate the impact of the EU retaliatory tariffs.\nThese procedures require a high level of administration and require authorisation in advance.\nSimilar type mitigation options may be available for goods undergoing processing in the US for eventual export, or goods that may be able to be initially stored/undergo processing in the US before possible sale e.g. foreign zones.\n5. Stay informed\nKeep abreast of ongoing negotiations and potential changes in trade policies. There may be changes to these measures in the short to medium term and expect news on the EU countermeasures imminently.\nAs global geopolitics continue to shift, staying ahead of the curve is essential for maintaining a competitive edge. So what do Irish business leaders need to consider?\nKPMG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Top Geopolitical Risks 2025 shows how by treating geopolitical risk as a fundamental part of business strategy, companies cannot only address threats but also seize opportunities, paving the way for growth and success.\nWith a team of over 50 VAT and Customs advisors, KPMG helps businesses manage the uncertainty created by the new US tariffs and EU countermeasures by:\nHelping you obtain and analyse your trade data, to provide you with a clear picture of your supply chain and where risks and opportunities lie\nUsing our tariff tools modelling the impact on the business of new tariff measures\nModelling and quantifying duty costs and opportunities under various \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat if\u00e2\u0080\u009d supply chain scenarios\nIdentifying and taking advantage of bonded warehousing, inward processing, free-trade zones and drawback to achieve savings and minimise duty costs\nReviewing classification and origin to identify opportunities to avoid or minimise increased duty costs\nReviewing valuation methodologies to reduce amounts subject to tariffs\nMonitoring developments to keep you informed of the evolving landscape\nContact our Indirect Tax team below to discuss how these tariffs could affect your organisation.

        "published_content": "Leona Maguire secures first victory on the Ladies European Tour\nLeona Maguire has made history again as the first Irish Woman to win on the Ladies European Tour at the Aramco Team Series in Hemel Hempstead London. \nAfter an impressive opening seven-under 66, Leona was a front-runner throughout the tournament and despite a challenging final round, she triumphed with a stunning eagle on the par-five 18th hole. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDermot, my caddie, he just kept saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098be patient, be patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Leona said afterwards, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand he said right before [hitting the second shot to 18], \u00e2\u0080\u0098let's hit the shot of the year here. It was just a perfect number, and my trusty hybrids came in useful at the end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nIt was indeed a contender for shot of the year, pitching in the perfect spot and feeding onto the green, coming to a stop around six feet from the hole. It quickly became apparent that an eagle would win her the tournament and she held her nerve with ice-cool and steely determination, rolling it right into the centre of the cup and sealing victory. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, I was just trying to hit a good putt. It was almost a little bit like a Solheim Cup,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew no Irish girl had ever won on the LET before. So, that putt was for me, that putt was for my family, and that putt was for Ireland. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a proud moment for all of us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nIn partnership since 2018\nIrish professional golfer Leona Maguire has been a KPMG ambassador since she turned professional in 2018.   \nLeona is a major player at the elite end of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s professional golf, securing 21 career Top 10 finishes, two career victories on the LPGA Tour and most recently her first victory on the Ladies European Tour at the Aramco Team Series in London.  \nIn 2022, Leona secured her maiden title and became the first Irish golfer to win a LPGA title at the Drive On Championship in Florida. \nThe following year, a near-flawless final round performance propelled Leona to a second LPGA Tour victory at the 2023 Meijer LPGA Classic in Michigan and Leona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standout performance at the 2023 Solheim Cup helped Team Europe hold onto the covered title for a historic third time in succession after a 14-14 draw at Finca Cortesin, Spain much to the delight of her supporters at home and abroad.  \nThis summer, Leona drew recording-breaking crowds to the 2024 KPMG Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Irish Open at Carton House. More than 9,000 spectators were in attendance on Sunday as Leona Maguire shot a five-under-par 68 to finish in a tie for 15th.\nCommenting on the success of the tournament and sport in Ireland, Leona Maguire said\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you see the progress it has made in the last few years. It is getting bigger and bigger every year. I think Irish sport is in a perfect place. It is fantastic to see 13 girls in the field this week and not just golf, all the sports. You see it with the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soccer team, you see with athletics, there is quite a buzz about women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sports in this country right now which is fantastic. Obviously, there is a long way to go, but we are moving in the right direction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nKPMG is very proud of Leona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s achievements to date, and we're excited to support Leona for the rest of the 2024 Season and beyond.\n2024 Season\nThe 2024 season was one of the busiest years ever for the elite female golfers, with the regular LPGA and LET circuit events and the five major championships accompanied by the Solheim Cup, which reverted back to even-year stagings and the KPMG Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Irish Open at Carton House.\nBooks for birdies\nKPMG are turning birdies to books for schools with Leona Maguire and the KPMG Women's Irish Open. \nCompeting at the top\n'The best way to deal with pressure is knowing that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re prepared.' Leona Maguire\u00a0plays in tournaments around the world throughout the season, from US, Ireland to Korea. We caught up with Leona to understand how she stays on top of her game and prepares herself ahead of each competition in order to build on her continued success.\nIt was a proud moment for all of us at KPMG when Leona made history by securing her first victory on the Ladies European Tour at the Aramco Team Series in London, this July. We wish Leona all the best for the rest of the 2024 season and look forward to seeing her in action, inspiring the nation at the 2025 KPMG Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Irish Open next June.\nSeamus Hand\nManaging Partner\nKPMG in Ireland\nI am grateful for the unwavering support from KPMG throughout my career. Their backing since I turned professional has provided me with the resources and confidence to compete at the highest level. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an honour to collaborate with a brand that values excellence and integrity, and their commitment to supporting women in sport and business is truly special. I hope to inspire the next generation of golfers to pursue their dreams with the same passion and dedication.\nLeona Maguire\nProfessional Golfer\nAfter a decorated collegiate career at Duke University which included three NCAA Player of the Year awards and\u00a0ACC Championships in 2017 and 2018, the Cavan native turned pro and became a KPMG brand ambassador in May of 2018. Her first professional appearance was at the 2018 Shoprite LPGA Classic in Galloway, New Jersey, USA. \nLeona competed primarily on the Symetra Tour in 2018 and 2019, with occasional participation on the LPGA and Ladies European Tours as well.\u00a02019 saw Leona take home her first two professional wins: the Windsor Golf Classic in California and the Symetra Classic in North Carolina.\u00a0Finishing seventh on the Tour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00a0Volvik Race for the Card\u00a0list, she successfully graduated from the  Symetra Tour and secured her\u00a0LPGA Tour Card in October 2019.\nIn February 2020, Maguire recorded her first LPGA top five finish. Then, in 2021, she recorded highest ever finish by an Irish female on the LPGA Tour by finishing second at the Lotte Championship. Since then, she has clocked up\u00a0a top-10 finish at the LPGA Mediheal Championship, a second place position at the Meijer LPGA Classic and her highest ever placing in a professional golf major with 15th place in the KPMG Women's PGA Championship in Georgia.\u00a0She was also selected as part of Team Ireland at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo last summer, which was her second Olympic appearance.\nIn addition to her inspiring Solheim Cup performance, Leona recently equalled the lowest Major score for men or women with stunning 61 at the Evian Championship.\u00a0She holds the records for most weeks at No. 1 in the World Amateur Golf Rankings (135), and best career scoring average for Division I Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Golf (70.93).\u00a0\nLeona finished in the top 10 at the US Women's Open in Pine Needles in early June - a huge achievement. \nTeam KPMG\nLeona is joined on #TeamKPMG by fellow professional golfers and KPMG ambassadors Stacy Lewis,\u00a0Mariah Stackhouse,\u00a0Yuka Saso, Maverick McNealy and\u00a0\u00c3\u0093laf\u00c3\u00ada Kristinsd\u00c3\u00b3ttir.",

        "published_content": "Each year KPMG Ireland review the global KPMG Supply Chain Stability Index, in association with the Association of Supply Chain Management index and consider what actions Irish business can take to minimise impacts to their business operations, and wider supply chains.\n2025 presents Irish businesses with many challenges that can disrupt their supply chains. From geopolitical tensions to natural disasters, the need for improved operational performance and robust supply chains has never been more critical.\nSince the beginning of 2025, there has been uncertainty as to the impact of global tariffs. Ireland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open economy makes Irish businesses particularly exposed to international fluctuations.\nThere is immediate groundwork all Irish enterprises can do to improve operational performance and strengthen weakened supply chains. This will ease more significant changes to their supply chains in the coming months and years, which we will continue to provide insights across tax, strategy, operations and economics as a firm.\nKey strategies and actions Irish businesses should consider today:\nBe efficient within your own facility\nEntering a period of uncertainty, it is critical that Irish businesses are trading efficiently. During rapid expansion organisations\u00a0 endure lower margin revenue lines and develop additional costs as a buffer to enable growth.\nIrish businesses should examine revenue\u00a0 lines, their profitability and margin enhancing opportunities, making decisions on poor performing revenue lines\u00a0evaluate their overall cost base, including indirect costs. Improving operational efficiency, understanding market losses, and scaling successful offerings are key strategies.\nPerforming this analysis upfront ensures Irish businesses can approach their external supply chain related challenges in a more reasoned manner, balancing organisational efficiency and external commercially focused negotiations.\nWork towards a diversified supply chain\nRegardless of global conditions, it has long been a logical, risk adverse strategy for Irish businesses to diversify their supplier base across different geographical regions, with a particular focus on where end customers are. Tariffs often apply not only to end products, but also components \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so it makes sense to orientate your entire supply chain near a customer base.\nEqually, it is becoming increasingly important to have multiple geographically spread suppliers companies ensuring a steady flow of materials and components, even if one supplier faces challenges, be they internal (operational, financial or legal) or external (geopolitical or climate change related).\nIn cases of sole sourcing, building a strong relationship with suppliers (as discussed later) is critical.\u00a0\u00a0\nInvesting in technology to streamline and increase accuracy\nAdvanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and blockchain can significantly improve operational efficiency, particularly in manufacturing settings. AI and machine learning can not only aid production line efficiency, but can also help predict potential disruptions by analysing vast amounts of data, allowing companies to take proactive measures.\nBlockchain technology such as that offered by ubloquity, a Northern Irish company, enhances transparency and traceability, ensuring that all transactions are secure and verifiable, particularly important with the ongoing increase in export related paperwork. Investing in these technologies can lead to more efficient and resilient operations and offer greater visibility to increasingly brittle supply chains.\nIndustry and government bodies such as Irish Manufacturing Research can also provide valuable support in adopting these technologies.\nCombilift, a Monaghan based global exporter of lifting and handling equipment, uses advanced robotics and AI-driven systems to optimise production lines, ensuring high precision and quality in their equipment.\nThis investment in technology not only boosts their operational robustness but also allows them to offer innovative solutions to their customers.\nStronger supply chain relationships\nMaintaining strong relationships with suppliers and partners is crucial. Companies should foster open communication and collaboration, ensuring that all parties are aligned, not just on where they interact (or \u00e2\u0080\u009cnodal points), but also ensuring absolute efficiency in internal operations which avoids unnecessary administration or rework. Regularly reviewing contractual performance and operational KPIs can help address any potential issues before they escalate.\nStrong relationships also facilitate quicker responses to disruptions, as suppliers are more likely to prioritise \u00e2\u0080\u009cfavoured, good customers\u00e2\u0080\u009d. While tempting to set prices with suppliers now, Irish businesses should carefully balance market pricing on commodities with hedging, especially for materials or components with limited global diversity of supply.\nTest these strategies with a limited supplier and customer pool and accurately model impacts on your wider organisation.\nRisk management and continuity planning\nWhile not top of every executive\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agenda, effective risk management is proving increasingly important in day-to-day supply chain management. Companies should conduct regular operational risk assessments and supply chain due diligence exercises, such as those offered by KPMG, or relevant industry associations such as CIPS, to understand vulnerabilities within their supply chains.\nContingency planning is equally important; having backup plans in place ensures that companies can quickly adapt to unforeseen circumstances. This includes having alternative transportation routes (and providers), potential call-off agreements with backup suppliers (depending on criticality of goods/components), and emergency response protocols. These should be reviewed regularly and tested as a paper exercise at least once every three months (or more frequently if a significant risk, or market conditions change).\u00a0\nConfidential Client*, an Irish haulage company, implements a comprehensive Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to ensure operational resilience. They conduct regular drills and simulations to test their response strategies, review and update their BCP periodically, and perform internal audits to maintain compliance.\nThis proactive approach not only enhances their ability to handle disruptions but also ensures they can continue providing reliable logistic services to their customers.\n*Client details kept confidential due to the nature of subject matter.\nSustainability practices to shorten supply chains\nIncorporating sustainability into operations and supply chain management not only benefits the environment but also enhances resilience. Sustainable practices such as reducing waste, optimising resource use and circularity of materials leads ultimately drives a transformation in operational efficiency, driving more robust manufacturing operations and mitigating some external cost pressures associated with using new materials.\nIndustry associations and specialised consultancies, including KPMG Sustainable Futures, can provide valuable guidance in integrating sustainability practices, while bodies including Irish Manufacturing Research can assist in developing sustainable, and circular manufacturing processes.\nThe Irish Government offers significant supports to aid businesses in becoming more sustainable, with a concerted focus on circularity, key resources include Circul\u00c3\u00a9ire, Climate Toolkit 4 Business\u00e2\u0080\u00afand the EPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Circular Economy Programme. Equally the Northern Irish government is exploring the topic too.\nContinuous improvement as a culture\nSupply chain and operational robustness is not a one-time effort; it requires continuous improvement. Companies should regularly review and update their supply chain and operational strategies, incorporating lessons learned from past disruptions.\nDepending on organisational preference this may follow a Lean or Kaizen methodology, externally driven, or may be as simple as an ideas box with an agreed review meeting.\nStaying informed about industry trends and emerging risks allows companies to adapt and evolve their supply chains to meet new challenges.\u00a0\nFive-step action plan for business leaders\nTo ensure your supply chain is robust and resilient, consider the following five-step action plan:\n01 Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment\nIdentify potential vulnerabilities in your supply chain and existing operations.\nUnderstand your underlying cost base, the impact of squeezed margins on each revenue line and key account.\nUnderstand the risks associated with your suppliers, transportation routes, and geopolitical factors.\n02 Diversify your supplier base\nAvoid dependency on a single supplier or region. Establish relationships with multiple suppliers across different geographical areas to mitigate risks. As appropriate, work with suppliers to eliminate waste within their operations too. Working with trade associations or partnering with peers can help access new markets.\n03 Invest in advanced technologies\nLeverage AI, machine learning, and blockchain to enhance supply chain visibility, predict disruptions, and improve overall operational efficiency. Industry bodies, government agencies and our automation teams can help.\n04 Foster strong supplier relationships\nBuild and maintain strong relationships with your suppliers. Open communication and collaboration can lead to quicker responses during disruptions. Moving from transactional to long-term strategic procurement is a key step in this process, as highlighted by CIPS UK.\n05 Implement sustainability to reduce supply risks\nIntegrate sustainability into your supply chain and operational strategy. Focus on reducing waste, optimising resource use, and developing a resilient circular supply chain. Industry associations as well as specialised consultancies including KPMG Sustainable Futures can help.\nBy following this action plan, Irish business leaders can create supply chains that are not only robust and resilient but also capable of adapting to the ever-changing global landscape. A resilient supply chain ensures business continuity and enhances competitiveness in the global market.\nGet in touch\nInterested in unlocking the full potential of your business?

        "date_published": "2025-04-17",
        "published_content": "The corporate world is on the brink of a significant shift in sustainability reporting, with the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) set to impact companies of all sizes. The European Commission\u2019s Omnibus proposal, published on the 26th February \u201ccontains provisions to simplify and streamline the regulatory framework with a view to reduce the burden on undertakings resulting from the CSRD and the CSDDD without undermining the policy objectives of either piece of legislation and to ensure more cost-effective delivery of the overall ambition of the European Green Deal related to the green and just transition\u201d. The proposed changes may reduce the number of businesses required to report under CSRD by 80% but are still subject to Parliament and EU Council approval, and transposition by Member States. While this may seem like a win for some companies, the evolving landscape raises important questions about how businesses should approach sustainability actions and reporting.\nWhat are the implications?\nFor companies with significant footprints in the EU there are many elements to consider. The proposed changes, which have sparked political debates, could delay or exempt many companies from reporting requirements, a decision that is still pending approval from EU member states. While these changes could reduce the immediate regulatory burden on companies, the landscape remains fraught with uncertainty. However, it is important not to lose sight of the bigger picture. The core question businesses must address is how to prepare for an evolving regulatory landscape. It\u2019s no longer simply about meeting compliance targets - it\u2019s about ensuring that sustainability efforts are meaningful, aligned with the business's long-term strategy, and built into the broader environmental, social, and governance (ESG) objectives. Whether or not the CSRD timeline shifts, businesses need to stay ahead by developing robust sustainability reporting strategies to adapt to other reporting standards coming down the track.\nThe Push for Action, Not Just Compliance\nA critical point centres around the need to focus on sustainability actions, not just reporting. While companies may have more time to comply with reporting requirements, it is imperative to use this time wisely to implement meaningful sustainability strategies. The temptation to view the delay as an opportunity to relax should be avoided. Instead, companies should continue focusing on improving transparency, reducing their environmental footprint, and driving genuine change. The CSRD's emphasis on \"double materiality\"\u2014assessing not just the impact of a business on the environment but also the impact the environment has on its financial performance and people - requires a strategic shift in how sustainability is viewed. It is important to focus on the end goal rather than the next hurdle. Against this complex regulatory backdrop, focusing on future strategy and taking outcome-based decisions for sound business reasons is the key to navigating the path ahead. This is a chance for companies to pivot from a compliance-driven approach to a strategic one, ensuring that their sustainability actions align with their brand and avoid falling into the trap of \"greenwashing.\" Just because reporting is delayed doesn\u2019t mean businesses should halt their efforts.\nDoes this mean that the EU is stepping back on sustainability?\nDespite the introduction of simplification measures on reporting, the EU Commission has shown a commitment to drive meaningful action on decarbonization through the launch this week of a Clean Industrial Deal (CID), which outlines a series of concrete actions to turn decarbonization into a driver of growth for European industries. The purpose of the CID is to ensure alignment on industrial and decarbonization policies by stimulating sector-specific investments. This is not just about achieving environmental objectives; it's about creating greater competitiveness and growth within the European Union. These measures have significant implications for the energy and infrastructure sectors. This strong message of the economic driver for decarbonisation also provides other benefits:\nAccess to capital - Renewables attracting increased investment and banks reporting higher risks in an energy sector where this isn\u2019t linked to renewables.\nBusiness resilience: Diversification of energy sources create opportunities for providers and suppliers and \u201chedges\u201d risk for the company.\nIt\u2019s good for your brand \u2013 consumers and investors are looking at ways to reduce their own sustainable impact, therefore align on priorities to your value chain. It\u2019s also good for staff retention and recruitment.\nGovernment support - implementing policies and incentives to promote the development of sustainable energy technologies and practices.\nAdapting to a Broader Framework of Reporting\nWhile CSRD remains a significant part of the regulatory landscape, other frameworks, such as the ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) and TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures), are on the horizon. These frameworks which focus on climate-related disclosures and nature-related risks will be crucial for the energy sector's impact on biodiversity and ecosystems, and are set to affect businesses globally, including those in the UK. Energy companies will be required to adopt a more holistic approach to sustainability, being mindful of the broader implications of sustainability, not only within their organisations but across their entire value chain. While some companies may fall out of scope under the proposed CSRD changes, the requirement for businesses to disclose sustainability data under other frameworks like ISSB and TNFD is likely to remain. This highlights the need for businesses to build systems that will allow them to comply with a range of standards, while also embedding sustainability at the core of their operations. Despite CSRD\u2019s shifting timeline, companies should prepare for future regulatory requirements, even if they are not yet in force. The key is developing long-term sustainability plans that encompass not just compliance but also value creation and resilience.\nBeyond Reporting: The Need for Strategic Vision\nUltimately, sustainability is not just about meeting regulatory requirements. It\u2019s about preparing for the long-term. Whether or not CSRD or other frameworks like ISSB and TNFD are immediately applicable, companies must continue to invest in sustainability programs that will help them future-proof their business. This involves not just collecting data but building robust systems that support sustainability goals and drive transparency across the value chain. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, businesses must remain agile. The delays and changes in reporting requirements shouldn\u2019t be seen as a sign to pause but rather as an opportunity to refine sustainability strategies. With the right approach, businesses can align their sustainability efforts with long-term goals that not only meet regulatory demands but also create value for stakeholders, investors, and the planet.\nThe Path Forward: A Pragmatic Approach to Sustainability\nThe landscape may be confusing, but inaction is not an option. Businesses need to focus on building sustainability frameworks now, preparing for the future, and utilising available tools to streamline the reporting process. With guidance and practical solutions, companies can manage the complexities of the evolving regulatory environment while continuing to drive meaningful change. As we await further developments in CSRD and other frameworks, businesses should stay proactive. The path to sustainability isn\u2019t just about complying with the regulations of today - it\u2019s about creating the foundation for the sustainable, resilient businesses of tomorrow.",

The global tax landscape is more dynamic than ever, with jurisdictions implementing measures to protect their tax bases and incentivize climate-friendly investments. Additionally, the rise of generative AI (Gen AI) and the shortage of tax talent are reshaping traditional tax roles and operating models, putting significant stress on tax functions. Navigating the forces of change in tax explores these complexities, offering strategic imperatives and actionable insights to help tax leaders navigate the forces of change. The publication highlights three key areas tax leaders should prioritize to create value for their organizations and outlines key steps to help achieve these goals and gain a competitive advantage.\nKey themes\nCoping with a dynamic and unpredictable tax environment\nTax functions are under immense pressure due to evolving regulations and fast-changing global events. For instance, 79 percent of respondents in the KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook believe trade regulation will negatively impact their organizations, while 56 percent express concerns about regulatory demands.\nMaking Gen AI work for tax\nGenerative AI (Gen AI) is set to revolutionize tax practices by automating compliance, enhancing data analysis, and improving decision-making processes. The KPMG 2024 CTO Outlook Studyopens in a new tab indicates that 29 percent of tax functions are already deploying Gen AI, with an additional 26 percent exploring its use.\nElevating and empowering tax teams for tomorrow\nWith the growing demand for skills in emerging technologies, tax leaders must focus on building agile teams equipped to handle the complexities of modern tax environments. The KPMG Global Tax Function Benchmarking Survey reveals that 44 percent of respondents identify employee recruitment and retention as the biggest disruptor impacting the corporate tax function.",

        "published_content": "\u00e2\u0080\u0098May you live in interesting times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 could have been the title of our latest Board Leadership Centre (BLC) event in Dublin, which took place less than 24 hours after US President Donald Trump dramatically paused the bulk of his planned tariffs for 90 days.\nThe focus of the event, with award-winning LBC radio broadcaster and author James O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien and economist and podcaster Chris Johns, was the UK-Ireland relationship, but events across the Atlantic and the implications for boards naturally dominated the discussion.\nIt was Johns, the Welsh-born former chief economist at Bank of Ireland, who pointed out that the \u00e2\u0080\u0098interesting times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 line is considered to be a curse, not a simple saying. A reminder that \u00e2\u0080\u0098interesting\u00e2\u0080\u0099 can be disruptive and uncomfortable, which certainly reflected the sentiment of the board members and business leaders in the room.\nRyan McCarthy, outgoing BLC Ireland Lead, who is taking up the role of Managing Partner of KPMG in Ireland on 1 May, cautioned there is no time for complacency, but said Irish businesses are up for the challenge.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really good muscle memory in the Irish business community, from things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve encountered in the recent past - the impact of the Ukraine war, Covid-19, even back to the global financial crisis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have good skills and competency and whilst it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always be easy, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also need to draw on the best of Ireland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agility and hunger, to retain what serves us well, while developing new strategies for success.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nJohns, who has worked in economic analysis in the UK and Ireland since the 1980s, gave a frank assessment: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe future is always uncertain but there is more uncertainty around than I can ever remember,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are moving into a very different economic world, as a result of the uncertainty and chaos.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe issue is not tariffs, per s\u00c3\u00a9; there have been other periods of tariffs, and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cone-and-done\u00e2\u0080\u009d round of tariffs could be digested, he said. The problem is the chaos coming from Washington, which didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end with the tariff postponement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn fact, the chaos became worse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johns said.\nIn practical terms, sustained uncertainty causes consumers to defer spending decisions. Likewise, companies start to cut back on discretionary expenditure and investment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf this chaos continues, it could well cause the recession that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re worried about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johns said.\nO\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien likened recent events to a \u00e2\u0080\u0098magic eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099 illusion, where a 3D image emerges from a page of 2D squiggles. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often felt that complicated politics and economics is a bit like that, and I just need to stare at it for a bit longer and the picture will appear. A week ago, I still thought that; now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just squiggles, and nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got any idea where any squiggle leads.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFor board members, it is extremely difficult to interpret events and plan accordingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to find out over the next while how resilient your businesses are, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get tests of your resilience structures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Johns \u00e2\u0080\u0093 echoing the pervasive theme of resilience that has been consistent in all BLC discussions over the past two years.&nbsp;\nEvents in the US could precipitate a new economic world order, akin to what the former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has described as an \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomic coalition of the willing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, to counter the stresses in economic and geopolitical relations that has stood since 1945.\nThat approach could see the EU, Canada and Japan, for example, reducing interest rates in unison, creating an \u00e2\u0080\u009calternative economy\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the one presided over by the US. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would make an awful lot of sense for [the UK Prime Minister] Keir Starmer to reach out and/or for the European Union to already have their arms open,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien.\nJohns notes that just 15% of world trade involves America; the countries that account for the other 85% could coalesce to replace their lost US trade by doing more business with each other. As well as the prospect of the UK getting closer to the EU, that raises \u00e2\u0080\u009chot button issues\u00e2\u0080\u009d like changing relations with China, and Asia in general.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suspect we are going to get closer to China because we have to, from a host of perspectives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Johns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt means the UK may well end up doing a free trade deal with India, in a way we never thought possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThese second- and third-order effects of events in Washington could open up whole new markets for exporting businesses, creating both challenges and opportunities.\nFor Ireland, the old \u00e2\u0080\u009ccloser to Boston than Berlin\u00e2\u0080\u009d dynamic is in the balance and new policy approaches appear inevitable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIreland has managed very successfully to ride those two horses, but I suspect the decision to choose one over the other is coming \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I hope it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Berlin rather than Boston\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johns said.\nThat decision will be significant because most Irish businesses are used to looking west for customers, expansion and M&A opportunities. Looking more to Europe and the east brings the actions of Russian president, Vladimir Putin, into focus and raises questions about Irish neutrality, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are going to be very profound questions asked of all of us. Our world is changing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nMeanwhile, President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willingness to do sector-based deals on tariffs leaves it difficult for businesses to take a united stand against policies that are damaging to them and, in some cases, to democracy, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are not going to want to say boo to that particular goose because you might be in there looking for a favour from him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nGiven the events in America, could \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or should \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Keir Starmer raise the prospect of the UK rejoining the EU? Noting that everything is in flux, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien said the answer is \u00e2\u0080\u0098No\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for now. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at the moment, but Starmer could be compelled to be interested in it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nKnown for his view of Brexit as \u00e2\u0080\u009can act of irredeemable idiocy\u00e2\u0080\u009d, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien said the emotional arguments that drowned out intellectual viewpoints in the Brexit debate are still playing loudly. Starmer fears \u00e2\u0080\u009ca vivification of the Brexit wars\u00e2\u0080\u009d, where \u00e2\u0080\u0098Leave\u00e2\u0080\u0099 voices such as Nigel Farage featured vocally in sympathetic media and old tropes about Britannia came to the fore.\nTo Johns, Starmer appears \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeeply scarred\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the Brexit wars. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you were in the UK at the time, you would be aware just how deeply visceral those wars were, and they were never really successfully concluded,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThings have changed since 2016 but a lot of the body politic, and Keir Starmer in particular, are behaving as if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still the day after the Brexit referendum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIf Starmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s timidity around Brexit is explainable, his approach to the UK economy is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca big strategic error\u00e2\u0080\u009d, according to Johns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrexit, lack of investment and other reasons mean that the UK economy hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grown on any meaningful metric for at least a decade and a half,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nData on UK capital spending, by both the public and private sector, ranks it as one of the lowest countries in the world for investment. Johns cited examples of capital investments being held up or cancelled because of planning challenges and red tape, drawing nods of recognition from the Irish audience.\nHe also took issue with the UK fiscal rules, which apply spending and public debt limits, based on forecasts, out to 2030. As someone who has \u00e2\u0080\u009ctried to do economic forecasting for decades\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he is confident any forecasts will be wrong. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, on the basis of numbers that we know are going to be wrong, they adjust spending and taxation policies today,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nA better approach would be to borrow for capital spending, where the return on investment is greater than the cost \u00e2\u0080\u0093 something that will be familiar to every board member involved in long-term planning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEconomic growth today is yesterday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the way it works,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Johns. In what may be turbulent times ahead, business leaders will do well to hold onto that adage.\nEconomics is a social science and O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien, an astute social observer, noted that prosperity and social cohesion are inextricably linked. Both are also linked to a population\u00e2\u0080\u0099s susceptibility to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe engines of division\u00e2\u0080\u009d, notably social media and certain traditional media in the UK, he said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not as vulnerable to it when things are going well, if you feel you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a country that is moving forward and progress is happening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of these things become much, much more dangerous when people are not happy with the size of their slice of the pie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe said that the British media played a large role in \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersuading people to punch down\u00e2\u0080\u009d against minorities and people who are already vulnerable. In the US, it has manifested in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re eating the cats, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re eating the dogs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 narrative about migrants.\nJohns highlighted differences between Ireland and the UK, which has an industrial working class that suffered from the closure of industries such as mining and steel, which never existed at scale in Ireland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIreland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history, your amazingly redistributive taxation and welfare system, and other factors lead to a very cohesive society. That is not true in the UK,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nBill Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former chief strategist, James Carville, once said that, rather than be reincarnated as the President, Pope or a star baseball player, he would like to come back as the bond market because it can intimidate everybody. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood old boring bond market\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as Johns described it, was the arbiter of President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariff plan, just as it was with the disastrous mini-budget proposed by the former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss in 2022, which ultimately cost her her job.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attract much attention in business headlines but the bond market globally, particularly in the United States, is the most important financial market there is. It dominates everything, and everybody really should pay a little bit more attention to it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johns told the BLC audience.\nHe raised the prospect of significantly more uncertainty if one particular possibility comes to pass: foreign holders of US debt being forced to take a haircut, effectively constituting a default by the US. This could be targeted, particularly at China, which holds about $760 billion of US debt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt sounds very esoteric but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not; it should be front and centre of your thinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe also noted that the chair of Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Council of Economic Advisors, Stephen Miran, has written about a proposal to devalue the dollar, which is the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reserve currency.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they start doing this default talk and the dollar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reserve status is threatened, then the last financial crisis will look like a walk in the park,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0093 reflecting how a US sovereign debt default would be catastrophic for the US and the global economy.\nAgainst the gloom, both O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien and Johns see Ireland facing the future from a position of strength. Exchequer returns are at record levels, there is virtually full employment in a young and growing population, and inflation is low \u00e2\u0080\u0093 albeit that current developments are obviously posing risks to Ireland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positive economic data.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the headwinds coming, you would much rather be Irish than British, from an economic perspective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johns said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I would urge you to consider the possibility that the headwinds are going to be very strong indeed. You are going to be tested.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRyan McCarthy backed Irish board members to ride the turmoil. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of complexity out there but the board community in Ireland is really vibrant, with a good healthy sense of challenge and common sense. We are all facing into this together, collectively we have the experience of dealing with major disruption and in KPMG we are committed to supporting boards in whatever way we can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nWrapping up, the incoming head of the BLC in Ireland, KPMG Audit Partner, Eamon Dillon, said the insights should be valuable when board members go back to their businesses and attempt to navigate these \u00e2\u0080\u0098interesting\u00e2\u0080\u0099 times as well as seeking opportunities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the key purposes of the BLC is to help board members to do their job in the most effective way and make the best decisions possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded. &nbsp;",

        "published_content": "Thailand issues Royal Decree No. 793: Reduction of personal income tax to 17% to attract the return of skilled Thai professionals\nKey updates\nOn 24 March 2025, the Cabinet approved the Royal Decree Issued Under the Revenue Code Governing the Reduction and Exemption of Taxes and Duties (No. 793) B.E. 2568 (2025), which provides substantial tax incentives aimed at attracting highly skilled Thai professionals to return to Thailand to support the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic growth and key industries. By offering a reduced personal income tax rate of 17%, and corporate tax exemptions on 50% of salary expenses, the policy makes Thailand more attractive to returning talent.\nCompanies or juristic partnerships in targeted industries that receive income tax exemptions under national competitiveness, investment promotion, or Eastern Special Development Zone laws will benefit significantly from a more skilled workforce while optimizing tax efficiency.\nKey highlights\nReduction of withholding tax rates\nThe withholding tax rate for income earners employed by companies or juristic partnerships in targeted industries is reduced to 17%. This reduced rate applies from 25 March 2025 (the enforcement date) until 31 December 2029. The income payer must meet the qualifications and adhere to the rules, procedures, and conditions set forth in the decree.\nTo be eligible, taxpayers must:\nbe of Thai nationality;\nhave a bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree or higher;\nhave work experience in countries other than Thailand for no less than two years;\nbe employed by a company as prescribed in the decree, and enter Thailand to begin work between the enforcement date and 31 December 2025 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the employer must notify the Revenue Department before the first salary payment, and the tax reduction applies from the notification date;\nhave not have previously worked in Thailand in the first taxable year of exercising the reduced tax rate, and must not have stayed in Thailand for 180 days or more in the two preceding taxable years;\nstay in Thailand for at least 180 days in the year in which the reduced tax rate is applied, except for the first or final year of eligibility; and\nmeet all qualifications and comply with the rules set by the Director-General.\nIncome tax exemption for companies\nCompanies or juristic partnerships operating in targeted industries as prescribed are exempted from income tax on 50% of the salary expenses paid to employees who qualify under this Royal Decree. This exemption applies to salaries paid from 25 March 2025 until 31 December 2029, subject to the specific rules, procedures, and conditions set by the Director-General.\nKPMG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s observations\nCompanies operating in targeted industries should assess their talent acquisition strategies to leverage this tax incentive. To secure the tax benefits, employers must ensure compliance with the notification requirements. The 50% income tax exemption on salary expenses presents a valuable opportunity for businesses to reduce labor costs while attracting high-caliber professionals. However, companies and individuals must carefully review the eligibility criteria and procedural requirements set by the Director-General to maximize the benefits offered by this decree. Early planning and proper documentation will be critical for successful implementation. With KPMG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expertise in global mobility, tax compliance, and corporate structuring, we can help you navigate this new incentive efficiently, and maximize the tax benefits offered by the Royal Decree, by providing, inter alia:\nguidance on effectively leveraging the 50% salary expense tax exemption to minimize corporate tax liabilities\nassessment of eligibility of both employers and employees to ensure they meet the conditions outlined\nfinancial impact analysis and cost-benefit assessments to help you optimize tax strategies\nassistance in implementing payroll reporting procedures that comply with the new 17% withholding tax rate\nassistance with preparing the required application forms to notify the Revenue Department and ensure timely submission for tax effectiveness.",

        "published_content": "When it comes to transactions, the focus tends to be on the \u201chard\u201d factors: the legalities, commercials and financials. Yet, with up to two-thirds of transactions failing to deliver value, something clearly doesn\u2019t add up.\nOur experience shows that it\u2019s often the softer, human-factors that are typically underestimated within deals.\nPeople play a critical role in the success of deals, with the acquisition of key talent often being a driver behind a transaction, but their experience is often a poor one.\nTherefore, how do we create an environment where an individual who joins an organization via a transaction would say \u201cI would have joined this company even if the deal had not happened\u201d?\nKey areas to focus on\nEmployee experience\nHow we shape this intentionally from end to end, increasing excitement and reducing uncertainty.\nCulture in M&A\nHow we prepare from a culture perspective pre deal and help the new workforce land positively and assimilate culturally, buying into the organization\u2019s mission, vision and values.\nOnboarding and talent retention\nSetting newly acquired talent up for success, helping them to say goodbye to yesterday and hello to tomorrow.\nLet\u2019s explore each area in a little more detail\nEmployee experience\nEmployee experience plays a critical role in a successful deal. While traditional communication and welcome initiatives are important, focusing on key business functions and critical talent is crucial for maintaining continuity and achieving deal objectives.\nHere\u2019s why employee experience is so important:\nImpact on business performance\nA positive experience leads to higher retention, productivity and morale. Satisfied employees are less likely to leave, ensuring continuity and minimizing disruption. They are more productive, leading to quicker realization of deal benefits, and are more motivated, contributing to the success of the deal.\nReputation and brand value\nAn organization with an engaged workforce can attract top talent, enhancing the company\u2019s reputation as an employer. This can also lead to improved client relationships, better service and a positive brand image within the market.\nOverall deal success\nBy investing in a positive employee experience, companies can minimize transaction-related risks, ensuring that key business functions are able to continue as usual, even when everything is changing. This ultimately lays the foundation for sustainable growth and long-term success, post deal.\nCulture in M&A\nNo matter the deal scenario, making significant change to an organization can be challenging. The approach to culture in a transaction can significantly and positively impact its success, especially when people are at the center of organizational value.\nHere\u2019s how we can tackle the cultural dimension, predict potential challenge and transition employees successfully, protecting deal value:\nUse data and AI to inform culture pre deal\nHaving access to culture insights to inform deal strategy has proven invaluable in a pre-deal environment. Utilizing generative AI and machine learning allows us to scrape publicly available data, constructing cultural comparisons between organizations. This gives the opportunity to address potential cultural challenges and areas of cultural alignment early, within the transaction strategy.\nFocus on assimilation, rather than post-deal integration\nFor decades, companies have pursued cultural integration, aiming to blend the best of both worlds. However, this often overlooks the human element. Instead, we focus on cultural assimilation, helping new employees adapt to the acquiring company\u2019s culture. This fosters a sense of belonging and accelerates the emotional transition.\nEnsure leaders set the tone from the top\nLeadership in deals is crucial to ensure successful cultural assimilation. Leaders should embody the desired corporate culture and build trust, communicating effectively, being understanding and celebrating successes. By fostering the right work environment, leaders can guide employees through the transition, acknowledging the past and embracing the future.\nOnboarding and talent retention\nGetting onboarding right is a key ingredient of successful talent management and is your gateway to employees\u2019 hearts and minds following a merger or acquisition.\nSo how do you ease the transition, make people feel welcomed and onboard them successfully?\nFirst impressions count\nDeal close isn\u2019t the first chance to make a good impression. There may be restrictions around communicating commercially sensitive information to your future employees, but they can start to get to know you from information that you make publicly available. They\u2019ll be checking you out online so it\u2019s important you provide a convincing and true picture of your organization.\nBe there from day 1\nWhether in person or virtually, ensure you are there to welcome your new employees. The power of online communication tools means we can welcome thousands of people, personally, all at the same time. Effective onboarding is about being there for your new employees and giving them access to the knowledge, tools and guidance they need to be successful.\nMake the most of digital\nDigital channels offer a powerful solution for effectively welcoming and engaging new hires. By leveraging digital tools and strategies, companies can ensure a smooth and successful transition for new hires, maximizing their engagement and contribution to the organization.\nSo, what can we take away from this?\nThe most successful transactions are often the ones that don\u2019t underestimate the crucial role of people in deals.\nTherefore, having an engaged workforce is fundamental to drive post-deal success and unlock the full potential of the transaction. That\u2019s where the real deal value lies.\nCase studies\nEmployee experience, onboarding and talent retention\nA Silicon Valley giant was acquiring a tech supercomputing company. The software engineers were a key aspect of this deal and a major source of IP and value for the acquisition.\nAs part of the employee experience and onboarding strategy, the transaction team implemented the gamified KPMG Digital Engagement Platform. This digital and social people engagement solution kept the workforce informed, engaged, equipped and connected throughout the transaction. Encouraging people to participate and get to know one another and the new culture helped both sides transition successfully and set teams up for success.\nAttrition was halved compared with past transactions \u2013 a critical success factor for this deal.\nKey role of culture\nA large player in the tech industry was exploring the acquisition of a SaaS start-up.\nThe main driver for the deal was the software capability so ensuring retention of critical talent was at the forefront of integration planning.\nAs part of the pre-deal work, the transaction team used an AI-based solution to run a culture assessment using publicly available data. The findings were presented to the transaction team on the Monday, to the CPO on the Tuesday and to executive leadership on the Wednesday \u2013 resulting in a change to the integration strategy by Thursday.\nThe findings drove a valuable discussion between the transaction team and senior leadership and ultimately shifted the direction of the transaction.\nMaximize long-term deal success with expert HR management and integration planning\nDespite the focus on legal and financial factors, many transactions can fail to deliver value. Often, it's underestimated that human factors make the difference.\nHow can we create an environment where talent joining through a deal feels they would have chosen the company, deal or not?\nFind more information about our M&A expertise\nRelated articles and more information\nClarity on Mergers & Acquisitions\nOvercoming the challenges of IT separation for M&A success\nIT \u2013 a key asset in M&A\nOptimization of the value chain with KPMG Elevate",

        "published_content": "The energy landscape is changing rapidly as the UK gears up to meet its Clean Power 2030 targets. A significant contribution is set to be made by offshore wind where a target has been set to treble the UK\u2019s current installed capacity of 15GW to around 40-50GW by 2030. Some key challenges and opportunities for the UK were outlined at our recent \u201cUnlocking the Energy Transition: The role of offshore wind in clean power 2030\u201d event. Critical auctions ahead. The upcoming Auction Round 7 (\u201cAR7\u201d) and Auction Round 8 (\u201cAR8\u201d) to award new Contracts for Difference (CfD) will be make-or-break to meeting the target. The panel was in agreement on the record levels of deployment needed and the sector is hoping for a \u201cbumper auction\u201d that sets the pace. Whilst most of the changes in policy have been welcomed by the industry, there are important next steps: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of awarding the contracts, as important as that is. It\u2019s also about having the supply chain and skills in place, while the consents need to be ready, the grid needs to be ready \u2013 all of the flow-through needs to be there.\u201d Jane Cooper, Deputy CEO of trade association Renewable UK. A Blueprint for Growth. KPMG supported RenewableUK in developing the Offshore Wind Industrial Growth Plan (IGP) \u2013 a blueprint for accelerating delivery while building UK supply chain strength. The IGP sets out targeted interventions across five key areas: cables, foundations, turbines, data, and operations & maintenance. It\u2019s now vital that the government backs this with long-term industrial strategy and funding, so the UK can capture more economic value as deployment scales. \u201cWe\u2019re in global competition here. The government has a critical role to play, with long-term policy clarity being a guiding light to attract investment and supply chain capacity. Uncertainty, on the other hand, creates complexity which adds to the cost of capital and, potentially, the cost to consumers.\u201d Simon Virley, Head of Energy and Natural Resources, KPMG in the UK. Collaboration is a non-negotiable. Collaboration across industry and government is essential to reduce delays and uncertainty. One important area where this can come into play is the discharge of consents, especially around environmental issues. Conditions imposed around environmental obligations can be time- and effort-intensive when they are dealt with on a project-by-project basis (such as the building of kittiwake towers for nesting or fish hotels that protect small fish). There is some welcome government support here such as the Marine Recovery Fund, but full implementation is needed and other schemes in addition. More work needs to be done to promote collaboration in the industry in order to develop a \u201clibrary of options\u201d that can be drawn on. Otherwise, dealing with conditions on a case-by-case basis slows projects down and creates uncertainty. The skills gap is real. Research from RenewableUK estimated that 100,000 people would be needed by 2030. Some progress has been made \u2013 there are already approaching 30,000 people employed in offshore wind and the figure is higher if one includes other tiers of the value chain \u2013 but the skills demand remains pressing, including many hard-to-recruit roles like electrical engineers. Modular training, graduate recruitment, apprenticeship schemes, transition pathways from other industries, and visa flexibility must all be part of the solution. Getting business to happen. More immediately, it is vital that the AR7 and AR8 auctions take place on time this year and next, and that contracts are awarded. \u201cQuite simply, we need business to happen. The final hurdle is the winning of a CfD \u2013 that allows developers to take projects forward and actually build.\u201d Danielle Lane, Director of Offshore Development, RWE. A large part of getting \u201cbusiness to happen\u201d is long-term policy clarity and certainty for investors. Massive changes in the market or policy could otherwise, all panellists agreed, risk the delivery of Clean Power targets. \u201cIt\u2019s been a speedy ride recently. But all the pieces are there. We need to gather ourselves, get some contracts awarded, and then move forward as an industry to get this done.\u201d Jane Cooper, Deputy CEO of trade association Renewable UK. While the UK forges ahead, global progress is uneven. Offshore wind in the US has stalled, Europe is mixed, and Asia \u2013 especially China \u2013 is accelerating. That global shift matters - as markets falter elsewhere, the UK can lead \u2013 but only if we move with purpose, unlock collaboration, and stay focused on delivery. It was a fascinating and illuminating discussion which made the magnitude of the task clear \u2013 but also provided encouragement that, with industry collaboration and the right policy framework in place, offshore wind can rise to the challenge.

        "published_content": "KPMG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s General Insurance Insights 2025 comprises two sections:\n1. Results and analysis Concise but insightful analysis of the general insurance sector using Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) statistical data. \n2. Industry trends Top emerging industry trends for 2025 and beyond. \nStrong insurer profits in 2024 were driven by a benign natural hazard period, premium price increases, COVID-19 business interruption provision releases and positive investment market returns. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost-of-living crisis, it remains important to acknowledge the cyclical nature of the insurance market and appreciate that premium price increases are reflective of pricing for increased disaster risk, inflationary pressures, increased costs of reinsurance and supply-chain shortages. A collaborative approach between the insurance industry, government and communities is needed to maintain an affordable and accessible insurance market for all Australians.\nKPMG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concise but insightful analysis of Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099a general insurance sector to 31 December 2024. \nThe 2024 insurance industry profit was $6.1 billion (previous 5-year average: $2 billion) being predominantly driven by a benign natural hazard period, premium price increases, COVID-19 provision releases and positive investment market returns. The insurance industry profit (before investment income, after taxes) was $3.1 billion (previous 5-year average: $0.97 billion).\nLosses from natural hazard events totalled $566 million for the industry, a significant reduction from 2023\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $2,356 million. In 2024, no catastrophes were declared and there were only two significant events: the Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day Storms in Victoria, and the Severe Weather in NSW and QLD in April. This compares to 2023, where two events \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Tropical Cyclone Jasper and the Christmas and New Year Storms \u00e2\u0080\u0093 were designated as Catastrophes. \nThis experience is reflected in the reduced natural hazard claims of 49,000 (2023: 143,900). Insurers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 natural hazard experience was generally below their planned-for allowances, and 2024 was the first year since 2019 that insurers recorded profitable underwriting results on their householders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 portfolios.\nInsurers saw strong GWP growth across most products driven by premium rate increases. Rate increases reflect pricing of worsening disaster risk, increased reinsurance costs, moderating claims inflation, and supply chain shortages.\nOn 20 September 2024, the Federal Court made a judgement indicating it intended to grant the application to \u00e2\u0080\u0098declass\u00e2\u0080\u0099 COVID-19 business interruption class actions. This favourable decision saw insurers significantly revise down provisions, releasing previous year provisions into current year profits.\nInsurers have maintained strong momentum investing in programs, technology, and strategic alliances to set themselves up for the future.\nInvestment in AI that helps identify customer pain points, better tailors and prices products more fairly, and creates other operational efficiencies has rapidly increased. \nIn a deal worth $642 million, Allianz has (subject to regulatory approvals) announced a strategic partnership with the Royal Automobile Association (RAA), to purchase the general insurance business of RAA along with a 20-year exclusive distribution agreement, effectively expanding its consumer insurance presence in South Australia.\nIn a deal worth $855 million, IAG has (subject to regulatory approvals) announced a 25-year strategic alliance with RACQ where it will acquire 90% of RACQ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insurance underwriting business, (with an option to acquire the remaining 10% in two years on consistent terms) and will provide RACQ general insurance products and services for RACQ members and Queenslanders. \nFurther, set-up of more responsive on-call teams that scale up for weather events, and community education programs for resilience preparedness, demonstrate an approach to managing the insurance value chain on many new and non-traditional fronts.\nIncome from investments (after taxes) was $3.0bn (previous 5-year average: $1.03bn) driven by strong performance of fixed interest securities, as well as most asset classes.\nDuring 2024, insurers continued to deal with the aftermath of making remediation payments and holding provisions related to ASIC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crackdown on insurers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to deliver on their pricing promises, which found consumers were overcharged $815 million for their insurance.\nThe industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital coverage at 31 December 2024 for direct insurers increased slightly to 1.82 times the APRA prescribed capital amount (2023: 1.76 times).\nThis section includes KPMG's views on the top general insurance trends that will shape and influence the industry for the remainder of 2025 and beyond. \nGeneral insurers continue to face pressure from the increasing frequency, severity and longevity of natural hazards, including floods, bushfires, and cyclones. Insurers must continue to work hand-in-hand with the government to manage these increasing risks in order to maintain an affordable and accessible insurance market for the Australian community.\nFollowing the impacts of Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred in early March 2025, communities in northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland are experiencing a recovery phase, with ongoing challenges including flooding, damage, and the need for support services. Many of those properties that were impacted during previous flooding events (2011 and 2022) were again impacted in 2025.\nAccording to the Insurance Council of Australia, the insured costs of extreme weather events have reached a record $22.5 billion over the past five years. Increased Commonwealth investment in proactive rather than reactive extreme-weather resilience measures remains essential. Amending building codes, reviewing zoning and land-use regulations, property buybacks, building flood levees, raising utilities and services above flood lines, and developing early warning systems are all examples of investing in mitigation measures. \nA good example of government mitigation efforts is the $400 million per annum Disaster Ready Fund announced in 2023 which is co-funded by the Commonwealth and state/local governments. This will fund natural disaster resilience and risk reduction projects to protect communities from the impacts of natural hazards and is part of a wider five-year $2 billion investment. This represents a continued shift to government forward-thinking towards natural hazard management, and communities will see the benefits in future years.\nThe 2025 Federal Budget provides $28.8 million over two years to fund programs such as the Bushfire Community Recovery and Resilience Program and investment in national mobile broadband emergency response capabilities. Additionally, the government cyclone reinsurance pool and Hazards Insurance Partnership between government and industry seeks to address insurance affordability and availability. The Insurance Council of Australia noted, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Initiatives like the Disaster Ready Fund and the Hazards Insurance Partnership have provided the blueprint for collaboration. We must now turbocharge this approach \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the investment required to support it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to ensure a stronger, more secure future for all\u00e2\u0080\u0099. In line with this, it has recently proposed \u00e2\u0080\u0098a big idea to combat a big problem \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the creation of a $30.15 billion, 10-year Defence Fund to deliver new flood defence infrastructure, strengthen or remove properties in harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way, and futureproof existing flood mitigation infrastructure\u00e2\u0080\u0099. \nThe government inquiry into insurers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responses to the 2022 major floods represents an opportunity for government, insurers and all Australians to recognise the devastating impacts of those floods, evaluate both successes and failings, and better plan for the next inevitable event. Without intervention, premium costs will continue to rise in high-risk areas which will result in insurance being unaffordable for many customers. In March 2025, the Insurance Council of Australia released its General Insurance Industry Action Plan: Our response to recommendations for change which outlines the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position on the remaining recommendations from the Parliamentary Flood Inquiry and the independent review of the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Code of Practice.\nInsurers hold significant data, research and understanding on weather events, that when partnered with government can contribute to a more resilient insurance market that protects all Australians.\nAn acceleration in digitisation is seeing insurers focused on creating the next-generation operation model. Significant investment in the creation of seamless customer experience, digital collaboration tools, data security, and driving towards a \u00e2\u0080\u0098target-state\u00e2\u0080\u0099 digital architecture have been front of mind. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) and the rise of AI agents provide an opportunity for insurers to shift how they operate, interact with customers and manage risk.\nAI has been a part of the insurance industry for some time and continues to provide the opportunity for insurers to more deeply understand their customers and risks, but adoption varies across the industry, including across insurance type and region. For insurers, this can mean policies that dynamically adjust based on real-time risk factors, claims that are processed and settled instantly without human intervention, and customer service that is hyper-personalised, context-aware and available 24/7. \nFurther, AI models can simulate future scenarios, improve risk estimation, inform better pricing and identify fraudulent claims. Some insurers have started using AI to provide insight into weather events and forecast climate risk from a national level all the way down to a sub-postcode level. Our global Intelligent insurance publication noted 74% of insurers are seeking growth through AI, and the benefits are already being realised, with 76% having seen a moderate to high ROI from their investments so far. On the back of this, 67% report planning to increase spending on AI.\nWhen deploying AI, insurers must ensure that AI is governed responsibly. Trust and ethics will need to be inextricably linked to AI design and operational success, with appropriate risk management practices critical to this. Many Australian insurers continue to maintain complex technology architecture, legacy systems, and manual or semi-automated processes that are inflexible when accommodating customer and regulatory change. Modernising the technology estate, addressing security and data privacy concerns, reducing data silos, and building new AI skills across the workforce will become more critical for insurers to unlock the potential of AI.\nRegardless of how much insurers digitise and embed AI, their people remain essential to success. Maintaining a strong employee value proposition to attract and retain staff by deploying the right working model is crucial. The impact of AI and automation on the workforce is likely to involve moving staff away from manual, repetitive tasks into more value-adding roles, with companies that offer digital upskilling and training becoming more attractive. In our recent global KPMG 2024 Insurance CEO Outlook publication, 85% of insurers believe AI will not impact the number of jobs, but AI will likely require upskilling of existing resources.\nSustainability reporting matters. It demonstrates how an organisation supports a sustainable society, ultimately benefiting investors, customers and employees. Our global ESG in insurance publication found 96% of the global top 250 companies now report on sustainability or ESG matters. The majority of global insurance CEOs say that ESG is fully embedded into their business as a means of value creation and Australian insurers should look to replicate this.\nThe market is increasingly asking for organisations to report on their sustainability and our global KPMG 2024 Insurance CEO Outlook found 63% of global insurance organisations are confident they will meet their net zero goals by 2030. Sustainability can also help drive competitiveness and increased sales \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as through the growing demand for green or ethical insurance products and investment options.\nSustainability reporting does present challenges. Unlike financial reporting information, for which there are long-established processes and controls, the same is not the case for non-financial information. This data is from all areas across the organisation and is notably less mature in terms of quality and completeness. Some Australian insurers have set ESG targets and are now working on operationalising and reporting against these targets. This involves significant collaboration across the business from the decision-making process, to systems, cultural change, and reporting.\nThe Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS) have been finalised and issued. In 2025 we will see the first reporting of climate-related financial disclosures that are required for certain entities under law. Insurers in Group 1, who will be the first to report at 31 December 2025, should be well advanced in finalising their ESG reporting program, operating model and planned assurance requirements. Insurers in subsequent groups should be setting up multifunctional project teams to work through the requirements of the standards to produce a roadmap to sustainability reporting and the related assurance requirements.\nBalancing profitability and insurance affordability remains a key challenge for Australian general insurers in a cyclical insurance market. Significant inflation pressures, natural perils, and reinsurance costs are pushing up premiums and claims costs, impacting affordability.\nInsurers are focusing on simplification and cost optimisation across the entire value chain, not just in traditional areas like claims management. Although there are always opportunities for greater efficiencies and cost savings in claims where a large portion of cost resides, there are other opportunities to drive cost and productivity. We are seeing insurers focus on improving disciplines in workforce management and streamlining, digitisation and process automation (in both traditional automation and generative AI), and modernisation and simplification of legacy systems. Insurers must continue to think strategically around simplifying and optimising their business, which may involve strategic partnerships with third parties to unlock value. Pricing strategy, customer retention, dividends and investment capacity are all served by having an edge in cost management and productivity.\nThe general insurance industry has seen significant regulatory change over the past few years, with regulatory focus remaining a constant area of focus. This has left many insurers little time to refine and mature their compliance and reporting practices. CPS 230, AASB 17 and the Financial Accountability Regime (FAR) are among the significant regulatory changes that have been or are currently being implemented.\nAhead of the implementation of CPS 230, the emphasis for resilient operations, underpinned by clear accountabilities and the strong management of material service providers has become more critical. The key themes are preparedness for risk events, resilience through disruption \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and protecting the organisation whilst managing the impacts to customers should not be underestimated.\nInvestment by general insurers to comply with AASB 17 was significant. Many of the smaller to medium sized insurers relied on tactical rather than strategic solutions. Insurers should be planning for further investment now in embedding longer-term solutions, to harness and derive value from the increasing data available. Increased data reporting requirements need to be supported by strategic data and technological architecture.\nFAR aims to increase transparency and accountability, by creating a culture of accountability. Accountable Persons will need to closely understand their obligations, and FAR covers a wide range of functions, with examples including data management, product design, staff training and financial reporting. FAR should not be viewed as a transactional regulatory exercise, but rather an opportunity to drive better governance, accountability and improve operations.\nCyberattacks are becoming ever more sophisticated, with attackers leveraging new technologies such as AI to develop targeted phishing campaigns. The increased usage of generative AI results in new attack content, malware and phishing material that is challenging to combat, with deepfakes lending more credibility to attacker methods. Digital crime is broad and far-reaching, extending from the manipulation of documents to falsify insurance claims through to the use of AI in voice detection in call centres, making it ever more difficult to detect fraudulent activity. The data and privacy risks posed by the sheer volume of data ingested by AI models risks exposing sensitive data publicly, thus undermining business trust.\nIt is critical for insurers to try and get ahead of the game, employing defence in depth controls to secure their ecosystem, as well as proactively updating their security strategies to leverage new technology for the better, proactively detecting threats before they happen.\nOur latest global Cybersecurity considerations 2025 report highlights the importance of the digital imperative in an AI world, where businesses are wanting to plough forward with AI quickly, but at the same time need to embed a level of trust in AI models and decisions being made. The need to race ahead safely while also balancing the focus on foundational security controls is as important now as ever. In our most recent KPMG 2024 Insurance CEO Outlook, cybercrime and cyber insecurity remained a top concern with only 54% (down from 66% last year) saying they were \u00e2\u0080\u0098well prepared\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for a cyberattack.\nThe rapid and ever-evolving nature of cyber risk poses a challenge to insurers to design appropriate and affordable cyber insurance products. Coverage is not able to be predicted based on prior claims experience, incomplete datasets make pricing premiums challenging, and the evolving nature of cyber risk itself is difficult to define in policies. In Australia, cyber insurance remains difficult to obtain and is only offered by a limited number of insurers. Insurers require a minimum standard of security controls prior to insuring a company, and this can create a barrier to entry to insurance for some organisations.\nLeveraging our insights and global knowledge, KPMG is committed to supporting the general insurance sector in navigating a rapidly evolving insurance landscape.\nOur team combines deep sector knowledge with extensive experience to address the risks and opportunities that matter most to insurers.",

        "published_content": "In the digital age, data security is paramount. For Swiss companies, this is especially true. Switzerland, known for its robust financial sector and stringent data protection laws, demands high standards. SOC 2 is a good way to demonstrate compliance with market expectations. SOC 2 is a comprehensive compliance framework for managing data securely. Particularly relevant for service organizations, including SaaS providers and cloud computing services. These organizations handle critical data and must meet rigorous audit assurance requirements. But what does SOC 2 compliance entail? And why is it so important for Swiss businesses? This guide explores SOC 2 compliance in Switzerland and its importance in risk management and cyber security. It also provides a clear roadmap to achieving SOC 2 attestation. Whether you're an IT professional, compliance officer, or business leader, this comprehensive guide will equip you with the insights needed to leverage SOC 2 for enhancing information security and customer trust.\nSOC Reporting Benchmarking: Insights for your assurance journey\nWe analyzed over 400 KPMG LLP Controls Assurance reports issued between 2021 and 2023 under frameworks such as SOC 1 (ISAE 3402/SSAE 18), SOC 2 (ISAE 3000), AAF 01/20, AAF 05/20, and other ISAE 3000-based reports. These covered Financial Services, Professional Services (including Consultancy, Payroll, B2C, BPO, and Logistics), Technology, and the Public Sector.\nWhat is SOC 2 compliance?\nSOC 2 stands for System and Organization Control 2, a framework developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). This compliance framework ensures organizations securely manage data to protect the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and interests of clients. While SOC 2 has been a standard in the U.S. for many years, its international equivalent can be found in the ISAE 3000 standard. Both standards help ensure data security and build trust. For Swiss companies, SOC 2 compliance is crucial. Switzerland's reputation for data privacy demands robust protection protocols. SOC 2 compliance assures clients and partners that their data will be handled with care. At its core, SOC 2 evaluates organizations based on five categories: Security: Safeguarding systems against unauthorized access and breaches. Availability: Ensuring systems operate as intended and are accessible when needed. Processing Integrity: Guaranteeing data processing is accurate and reliable. Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized disclosure. Privacy: Ensuring personal data is collected, used, and retained responsibly. SOC 2 provides Swiss companies with a roadmap to manage information security effectively. Following these criteria helps organizations uphold their own high standards while also ensuring compliance with broader regulations, such as ISO 27001, GDPR or NIS2. It also enhances their reputation in the global market through thorough audit assurance and audit reports.\nSOC 2 type 1 vs. SOC 2 type 2: What Swiss companies need to know\nWhen seeking SOC 2 compliance, companies choose between SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 2 Type 2 reports. Understanding their differences is vital for informed decision-making. For many Swiss businesses, SOC 2 Type 2 is often the preferred choice. It offers a more comprehensive view, demonstrating long-term commitment to security compliance. Type 2 is especially appealing to clients and stakeholders. It builds trust by showing a commitment to maintaining robust security measures. This level of diligence is critical for companies that handle sensitive data or are in competitive markets.\nWhy SOC 2 matters for Swiss businesses\nSwitzerland\u2019s reputation for data privacy demands more than baseline security measures. SOC 2 compliance delivers critical advantages: Reputation: Achieving this SOC 2 demonstrates a strong commitment to information security and privacy. Building Trust: SOC 2 assures clients and partners that their customer data is secure. Regulatory Alignment: It supports adherence to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP), GDPR, NIS2 and ISO 27001 standards. Competitive Differentiation: SOC 2 sets businesses apart, signaling robust risk management and commitment to security compliance. Risk Mitigation: SOC 2 helps identify vulnerabilities, reducing exposure to data breaches and financial penalties. By integrating SOC 2 into their security operations, Swiss organizations can turn compliance into a competitive advantage.\nSOC 2 compliance in cyber security\nIntegrating SOC 2 into your risk management strategy offers numerous advantages. SOC 2 provides a framework that aligns security measures with business goals. This ensures that your organization can manage risks effectively. SOC 2 helps identify potential vulnerabilities in systems and processes. This proactive approach aids in minimizing data breaches and financial risks. Continuous risk assessments are crucial for adapting to new challenges. Cybersecurity is a pressing concern for companies handling customer data. SOC 2 compliance strengthens an organization's security posture. It instills robust measures to protect against unauthorized access and security incidents.\nSteps to achieve SOC 2 compliance in Switzerland\nAchieving SOC 2 compliance in Switzerland involves several key steps. This journey requires careful planning and a thorough understanding of SOC 2 requirements.\nOvercoming challenges in SOC 2 compliance\nSwiss companies often face several challenges on their path to achieving SOC 2 compliance. One common hurdle is understanding the complex requirements and aligning existing practices with the five categories. This complexity can be daunting, especially for businesses new to compliance frameworks. Additionally, resource allocation can pose difficulties. Smaller companies might struggle with dedicating the necessary time, personnel, and financial resources to SOC 2 efforts. The investment needed for compliance can strain limited budgets and capacity. Fortunately, several resources and tools can assist in the SOC 2 compliance journey. Engaging third-party consultants with expertise in SOC 2 can provide valuable guidance. Various software solutions are available to automate and streamline compliance processes. These tools make the journey easier and more manageable for Swiss businesses.\nLeveraging SOC 2 for a competitive edge in Switzerland\nFor Swiss companies, SOC 2 compliance is more than a compliance framework\u2014 it\u2019s a strategic enabler. SOC 2 enhances trust, strengthens risk management, and ensures alignment with stringent data privacy laws like GDPR, NIS2 and ISO 27001. As Swiss businesses strive for global competitiveness, SOC 2 compliance provides a roadmap to secure operations and lasting success. Embracing SOC 2 compliance helps Swiss organizations protect their data. It also builds the trust needed for success in today\u2019s connected world.\nMaintaining SOC 2 compliance: a long-term strategy\nAchieving SOC 2 compliance isn't a one-time event. Continuous monitoring is crucial to ensure that SOC teams and security measures remain effective over time. This ongoing process helps Swiss businesses adapt to new threats and maintain a robust security operations center (SOC). Regular audit reports and assessments are essential to uphold SOC 2 requirements. Staying proactive in compliance efforts ensures that policies and controls are always in line with industry best practices.",

        "date_published": "2025-04-16",
        "published_content": "The next 18 months will see more changes in cloud economics than the prior 5 years combined. Enterprises will need to adapt their strategy and practices to deliver best value against this backdrop of change. We will see the premiumisation of hyperscale cloud, with exponentially greater value delivered through higher cost services on public cloud, with the potential for the increasing costs of higher premium consumption offset by increasingly (relatively) competitive non-hyperscale infrastructure for lower value workloads.\nThis article explores:\nWhat is the premiumisation of cloud?What is driving changes in cloud economics?How KPMG sees premiumisationThe impact on Cloud services for enterprisesHow enterprises need to adapt?\nWhat do we mean by the premiumisation of Cloud?\nThe premiumisation of Cloud is a phenomenon we see in public cloud whereby premium services become the dominant part of the offering, attracting a correspondingly premium price. Let\u2019s break that down:\nThe cloud is the primary means by which most enterprises get the latest digital technology\nIt has always included premium services such as the latest analytics tooling, but generative AI in particular sees a significant gulf between mid-market capabilities on non-public cloud services, and the premium capabilities on public cloud\nThese services are costly to develop, therefore necessitate high prices\nAnd they have a significantly higher value to customers of public cloud who will pay this premium\nWhat is driving these changes in cloud economics?\nFundamentally, the availability of innovation (especially around generative AI) is combining with four powerful forces to disrupt the cloud economic model which has prevailed in the market for nearly a decade:\nWhy does KPMG think this will result in premiumisation?\nHyperscale computing costs are increasing (even without generative AI) for the same reasons inflation has affected many sectors \u2013 energy, labour and supply chain costs. This means the cost of cloud computing overall will increase and that\u2019s especially the case because generative AI is both compute intensive, but also demands newer and more sophisticated chips.\nThe customers of hyperscalers are using the sophisticated capabilities of their platforms to transform their own enterprises \u2013 to reduce cost, manage disruption or to serve their customers or citizens better. It makes little sense to slow down the potential of this innovation and switch to a cost play. And if the supply of their compute and storage risks being constrained, it\u2019s logical they would price to incentivise consumption towards the highest value, higher cost capabilities.\nBut for their competitors (and let\u2019s remember non-hyperscale infrastructure providers have also seen healthy growth), the technical barriers to interoperability have reduced and regulators such as Ofcom are applying pressure for this to continue (e.g. the removal of egress costs). For them a cost play to secure lower value, less mobile commodity compute and storage does make sense \u2013 it\u2019s their core business.\nWhat does this mean for the cloud services enterprises consume?\nUse of public cloud concentrates on higher value, premium services like generative AI which enable more complex and intelligent solutions for data analysis, automation, and decision-making\nSimple storage, compute goes to the lowest cost platform, and non-hyperscale providers provide economic, basic services plus tailored packages of capabilities for specific products and industries\nThese trends won\u2019t be absolute (i.e. there will never be a clean dividing line between premium and commodity), but even if directionally right there are a number of implications.\nFinally, these implications change the ways enterprises seek value from cloud, and so they change the way they need to architect and organise for cloud. Public cloud is where most value will be created, so enterprises need to be able to exploit it effectively. But it\u2019s not enough to say hyperscale cloud is always the best solution to create value: being flexible, portable and value oriented is most important.\nWhat should CIOs consider to enable this flexibility, portability and value orientation?\nMore routinely modelling and reviewing the cost of your cloud workloads and what value they generate \u2013 to avoid being caught off-guard by price increases or missing opportunities in the market. KPMG\u2019s Transformation Impact Modeller is helping clients do this for over \u00a35bn of spend\nManaging value effectively from premium workloads, including understanding whether your speed to deliver is competitive, investing in initiatives such as KPMG\u2019s Cloud Value Lab to properly explore and define value from breakthrough capabilities\nArchitecting for premiumisation \u2013 by ensuring your architecture supports future portability and minimises lock-in within your Landing Zones, automations, controls and major architectural choices such as containerisation\nResetting your toolset choices to consider portability and the ability to manage high value, high velocity workloads and low churn, commodity workloads in different platforms and at different cost points\nAssessing, designing and engineering the Data Architecture to be most effective in a hybrid cloud environment \u2013 for example, what you store in the cloud versus what you expose to the cloud when needed\nRethinking the skills which are needed \u2013 and the extent to which your skills create dependencies on individual platforms which impede being dynamic as the relative value of platforms changes\nCSPs are pushing new premium services to create more value for their clients. The value and cost of innovation is combining with supply-side constraints on energy, chips and other hardware components, moving cloud services towards higher-cost, higher-value premium models. This isn\u2019t just about the cost on the price tag, it\u2019s also about changes in the products on the shelf.\nThis will incentivise enterprises to review their strategy, working out new ways to create value from premium services and take efficiencies from commodity services. This will change enterprise cloud strategies and the way they are executed \u2013 or at least, it will for those who stay ahead of the curve.",

        "published_content": "Gender pay gap reporting is now mandatory for organisations with over 150 employees. Such organisations must publish their gender pay gap on an annual basis.\nGender pay gap reporting is now mandatory for all organisations in Ireland, both public and private, with 150 employees or more. They must publish a report on their website that details their hourly gender pay gap across a range of metrics - this must be done by December for 2024 and it is intended that from 2025 the reporting deadline will\u00a0move to November. In 2025, this requirement will be extended to organisations with 50 employees or more.\n\nWhat is the gender pay gap?\nThe gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly wages of men and women in an organisation, regardless of their seniority.\nThe gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay; it is a different but connected issue. Equal pay relates to the prohibition of pay differences between men and women for \u201clike work\u201d, \u201cwork of equal value\u201d or \u201cwork rated as equivalent\u201d. Such variations are not permitted under Irish law and employers are required to address and resolve this.\nEven if an employer does not have an equal pay issue, a gender pay gap may still exist. For example, the majority of lower-paid roles in an organisation may be filled by women.\n\nWho is it relevant to?\nGender pay gap reporting applies to employers with 150 or more employees. This threshold will reduce to 50 or more employees in 2025. It applies to the public as well as the private sector.\nWhat needs to be disclosed?\nAffected organisations must disclose:\npay differences between male and female employees including hourly pay and bonuses\ndata across a range of working arrangements including part-time and temporary contracts\nthe proportion of male and female employees who receive benefits-in-kind and bonuses\nthe number of male and female employees across four pay bands\nthere may also be a requirement to publish differences in pay by reference to job classification.\nContext will be key. Employers must set out the reasons for the differences, as well as the measures taken (or proposed) to eliminate or reduce the gender pay gap.\nWhere is it reported?\nEmployers must publish their gender pay gap report on their website each December. Plans are also in place to develop an online reporting system, which will consist of a central portal where all employer reports will be uploaded and can be accessed publicly.\nWhat if a company decides not to comply?\nThe legislation includes several measures to tackle non-compliance. These measures include the facility to apply for an order from the Circuit Court or Workplace Relations Commission compelling an employer to comply.\nWhat actions should employers take?\nEmployers should address the following key priorities as they prepare to report on their gender pay gap:\nUnderstand what must be reported. Ensure systems are in place which can easily produce the statistical data for publication.\nCalculate your gender pay gap. Identify any equal pay risks or other systemic issues giving rise to the gap.\nIdentify initiatives and plans to address the gap.\nUse data analytics to understand the root causes or why certain groups of staff are especially affected.\nCraft the narrative of your gender pay gap disclosure and develop your communication plan. This could include sharing and discussing the data internally before going public.\nWe are here to help\nWe can help you every step of the way and achieve compliance. We can:\ncalculate and validate your gender pay gap reporting numbers.\nidentify and conduct additional analysis to contextualise the numbers.\ndevelop a communication plan to get the messages right internally and externally.\nidentify and accelerate existing projects to address diversity and inclusion.\nreview your current strategy to improve future disclosures.\nContact our experts if you would like more information on calculating, reporting or addressing your organisation's gender pay gap.",

        "published_content": "Generative AI burst onto the scene over two years ago, promising to revolutionize workplace productivity and empower employees to focus on high-impact tasks. But has it lived up to its potential? And can it truly address the productivity challenges facing businesses today?\n\nIn this episode of Take on Tomorrow, hosts Lizzie O\u2019Leary and Femi Oke tackle these questions with Svenja Gudell, Chief Economist at the jobs site Indeed, who provides insights into how GenAI is already influencing the labor market and workplace trends. Pete Brown, PwC\u2019s Global Workforce Leader, joins the conversation sharing key findings from a new World Economic Forum and PwC report, highlighting practical strategies for integrating GenAI to boost productivity and support workforce augmentation.\n\nWith businesses striving to balance innovation and efficiency in a challenging economic climate, this episode is a timely look at how GenAI can help shape the future of work.\nSVENJA GUDELL: It\u2019s not that GenAI will take your job, right? It\u2019s the person that knows how to use the tools that\u2019s probably going to take your job.\n \n PETE BROWN: You can protect people, but you can\u2019t protect jobs. Jobs will continue to evolve, they always will be.\n \n SVENJA: You have to be a bit of a dreamer, right? It\u2019s going to be really amazing if you look into the future to see what could be with this technology.\nLIZZIE O\u2019LEARY: Two years ago, it all felt like the world\u2014including our jobs and how we work\u2014would change forever.\nFEMI OKE: ChatGPT and other similar GenAI technologies crashed onto the scene, impacting the way we think about everything. From drug discovery to how we communicate.\nLIZZIE: Now, more than two years later, how is it changing how businesses run? And how can organizations roll out the technology to create a real impact\u2014helping workers become more productive along the way?\nLIZZIE: From PwC\u2019s management publication, strategy and business, this is Take on Tomorrow. I\u2019m Lizzie O\u2019Leary, a podcaster and journalist\u2026\nFEMI: \u2026and I\u2019m Femi Oke, a broadcaster and journalist. This week: how is GenAI transforming the job market? Today, we\u2019ll be talking to Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Indeed, a global job site. She\u2019s been looking into how GenAI is transforming the workforce.\nLIZZIE: First, we have PwC\u2019s Global Workforce Leader Pete Brown with us to talk about what we can learn from companies considered \u201cearly adopters\u201d of GenAI. Welcome back to the show, Pete.\nPETE: Thank you, Lizzie, thank you, Femi. It\u2019s lovely to see you.\nLIZZIE: Pete, we have talked about GenAI in the workforce and workplace on this show before. But what is the conversation that is happening today in companies? Are they eager to embrace this technology?\nPETE: As I reflect through probably every single conversation I\u2019ve had with a client in the last year, and I, dare I say, if I added all my colleagues at PwC as well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any conversation where the words GenAI haven\u2019t come up. Does that mean they want to embrace it? I think it depends on the organization. Some are and some are yet to start, but it\u2019s certainly sparked huge curiosity and interest. There\u2019s no doubt. What was really surprising to me, though, against that backdrop and this tsunami of interest, is that we survey workers every year just to work out what\u2019s on their mind, what\u2019s motivating them in the world of work. And only 12% of workers say they\u2019re using GenAI in their day-to-day work. That was a surprisingly low number for me. So, I think, to answer your question, huge conversation topic, varying degrees of implementation adoption.\nLIZZIE: Later, we\u2019ll hear how GenAI is completely transforming the way some businesses work. But first, what workers really need to know, about what GenAI will change in our jobs. Femi, you spoke to Svenja Gudell, who\u2019s been looking at this in her role as chief economist at Indeed.\nFEMI: Exactly\u2014and I began by asking her about the type of changes and trends she\u2019s noticing in her work.\nSVENJA: AI is everywhere, right? We have been talking about it nonstop and are actually able to see some of these movements in our data. So we\u2019ve developed a new generative AI tracker that looks at all the different mentions of GenAI inside job postings. It could be either for the creators of GenAI, for example, someone that has to provide a particular prompt or a user of GenAI, a marketing professional that has to be able to deal with these tools. And we saw that over the last two years an 83 X increase in those mentions. But we\u2019re still only about two out of every thousand jobs mentioning some sort of GenAI term\u2014so, still early days here.\nFEMI: Svenja, you are in a position to see trends across different economies in different parts of the world. What are you seeing?\nSVENJA: They\u2019re looking at what types of frameworks do we need to have in place in order for GenAI to be successful in a given economy, right? Do you need certain digitization to have happened already? What does the educational system look like? What other supports pillars do you need in order to make sure that GenAI can be used for good and have a productive impact in emerging economies versus fully developed economies? So, there are a lot of conversations happening with that. And I think [we\u2019ve] made great strides in terms of providing access to a lot of people. But how as a world, can we make sure that no one is left behind? So, the basic needs are met in order to have GenAI be a tool that can be productive in a bunch of different settings.\nFEMI: So, what kind of tasks can GenAI help most with?\nSVENJA: It really helps to understand first what skills are being impacted, because a job really is a collection of skills and tasks that you perform, and GenAI is quite good at the technical knowledge\u2014having a bunch of information gathered across really the entire web and everywhere else it can access this knowledge. So, quite good at that. Not so great at problem-solving skills, like leadership skills, empathy, creative problem-solving. And the results were very mixed when looking at all skills and the need for physical execution, actually being physically present. Sometimes GenAI does really well, because you\u2019re coding, for example, you can do that remotely, right? It doesn\u2019t require physical presence. However, if you\u2019re taking blood, you\u2019re a nurse, having an actual physical presence there is really important. So, there GenAI doesn\u2019t do all that well. So, I think the really important thing is, as you figure out what is GenAI good at, and what does that mean for me, I always think, it\u2019s not that GenAI will take your job, right? It\u2019s the person that knows how to use the tools that\u2019s probably going to take your job. So, get in there, go figure out how to use these tools to your best advantage, and see how you can be a more productive version of yourself.\nFEMI: Svenja, we\u2019ve been discussing AI as helping us do our work better, and what additional tools can it bring to our work. But is there a way that GenAI could actually create new kinds of services and new kinds of work?\nSVENJA: Absolutely. To me, GenAI is a game changer, just like with the computer, which was also a game changer and fully introduced new jobs out there. I don\u2019t think, at least with current data, that GenAI is going to wipe out whole jobs. It will, however, create new jobs, right? The prompt engineer, for example, is a pretty new job out there. Of course, some aspects of jobs will become obsolete. That\u2019s normal. That happens as part of any transition in the labor market. But I think you have to be a bit of a dreamer, right? A bit of an optimist to see what are the cool things that could actually happen with this. And I think we\u2019re starting to see some of these things happen, and in real life, already. In farming, this technology, where you have image detection of weeds in a field that happens [in] real time. And then a laser goes in and zaps the weeds in the field as the machine drives through the field. And that takes a ton of AI. And it\u2019s just amazing, right? And I think it will become incredibly powerful when you start to combine the thought of self, if you will, of GenAI with the actual machine, the automation part of things, right? If we can have robots be smart thinkers and react to certain things with the help of GenAI, I think the possibilities will be amazing in terms of what we can do. And I\u2019m pretty optimistic that we\u2019re onto something here [laughs]. We\u2019ll see some really cool applications, and it\u2019s still incredibly early to see a lot of that.\nFEMI: GenAI is supposed to help us save time, be more productive. But what could be the challenges to this in the workplace?\n\nSVENJA: We talk about GenAI as being an incredible timesaver at first and can start to help us do anything really fast. And there is a distinct learning curve here, right? There is: You have to actually understand how to use this tool. You have to make sure there are no hallucinations in the answer, meaning you\u2019re not getting made-up things back from the tool. And I think that\u2019s really important to recognize. There is a training curve, and you\u2019re going to have to learn a whole lot of stuff\u2014how to interact with these and how to most properly use them before you can actually start to save a whole bunch of time. And that\u2019s normal. That\u2019s always the case for new tools.\nFEMI: So, if you were going to advise somebody who\u2019s looking for new work opportunities in the job market, what would you tell them about GenAI?\nSVENJA: First and foremost, I feel like people should always be passionate about the job that they do, right? So, I know it\u2019s always my first answer: find something that you love to do, because that\u2019s going to help you stick with it, right? But then, given the fact that currently GenAI is not whole slate replacing anything quite yet. I think it\u2019s really important to choose a job that you think you want to do, for which there\u2019s good demand out there, right? And then learn the tools that will actually help you be successful in that job. So, if you\u2019re an economist, I would strongly encourage you to start to learn how to code things and how to work with large datasets. Maybe you want to learn some large language models and how to work with those in order to do a fairly detailed research on whatever topic you\u2019re getting into. So I think all these things are really important. Know the tools, know the technology and how you can use it to actually get to your goals faster. And if you take a step back for a moment and look really big picture, if you look at where we are in the US and many other industrialized countries around the world, we\u2019re facing a bit of a demographic cliff. Our labor force is going to start shrinking because our populations are getting older. And that means we\u2019re going to start feeling the crunch in terms of workers very soon. So, workers are going to be in demand. So you can think about healthcare being a really large sector that\u2019s going to continually demand new workers. And then, how can you use these tools to be able to make you even more productive in that setting?\n\nFEMI: I\u2019m thinking about policymakers who are listening to our conversation right now and listening to the changing work landscape. What recommendations would you give to them regarding GenAI in the workplace?\n\nSVENJA: Policymakers have a pretty tricky job. They have to figure out what should be regulated. Can it be regulated? Does it need to actually be regulated? And, especially for policymakers\u2014although I\u2019ll say a lot of companies are thinking about this as well, of course\u2014the side-effects of GenAI are really important to consider, right? There are certain biases that are inherent in our data, and we train our models on. So how do you make sure that these biases aren\u2019t carried forward? So they\u2019ll have ethical considerations to be paid attention to. You want to make sure that no one is left behind in this advancement. Does everyone have access to this technology? What does it mean for workforce training? What kind of government support does there need to be in order to have successful upskilling, reskilling, to actually have workers fully embrace this type of technology? So I think there are a lot of open questions.\n\nFEMI: Svenja, what can businesses, government, even different societies around the world learn from one another about how this technology is being implemented and what its impact will be?\n\nSVENJA: If you look at a lot of industrialized countries, of course, the skills are similar that are needed to do different jobs. So there, the labor market impact will be quite similar, but the adoption rate can differ quite a bit. So, we actually just did a study and looked at results for Japan versus the US. And we found that while in the US there\u2019s a bunch of anxiety around AI, right?\u2014a lot of people are still iffy on what does this actually mean? What does it mean for me? What\u2019s going to change? In Japan, survey respondents actually were much more optimistic and much more open to figuring out, OK, how might we adopt this? Well, how can we use it? Even though they\u2019re not actually using these tools as extensively quite yet. I think the US is showing a lot more adoption on these tools so far. So there are different speeds of adoption that we\u2019re starting to notice and different cultural bends in terms of, you know, how open are you to incorporating this? \u2019Cause you know, change is hard. And that\u2019s one really interesting thing that\u2019s starting to pop out in the data, and we\u2019re closely watching.\n\nFEMI: Svenja, thank you.\n\nSVENJA: Thank you so much for having me. It was a pleasure.\n\nLIZZIE: Pete, you recently collaborated with the World Economic Forum for their report on GenAI for job augmentation and productivity. You talked to some 20 organizations about the lessons that can be learned from the early adopters of GenAI. What are some examples of how this tech is being used by various organizations?\nPETE: Many organizations have lots of policies and procedures, and, historically, I think it\u2019s quite tiresome the way people interact with those who understand how stuff gets done. Some organizations have embraced GenAI based around those policies, actually enabling employees to get much faster answers, more accurate answers, much quicker than before. And I think that does a couple of things: I think it enhances employees\u2019 enjoyment in work and it creates greater efficiencies. Another good example would be, a number of organizations in the whole recruitment space. In the world, there is a fierce competition for those with skills, and we know there\u2019s a shortage of critical skills in the world of work, generally. One of the metrics that many organizations use is the time to hire, how they find the right person, right individual, the use of GenAI in that process, to be able to source more accurately, to find the right talented people in the right part of the world, as fast as possible. And then, as they bring them through the process of recruitment, GenAI and its role in that process has been, I think, truly transformational in terms of shortening that time to get the right critical resources into the organization.\nFEMI: So what are businesses divulging to you about where they\u2019re seeing the real gains with this technology, Pete?\nPETE: I think, look, one of the things that is consistent with many organizations where they\u2019ve been either piloting or implementing is they\u2019re seeing that it\u2019s starting to do things that used to take weeks and months in a matter of minutes. And often, when you delve into that and look at the kind of activity that\u2019s been undertaken, it\u2019s that, dare I say, mundane stuff, the administrative stuff, the repetitive things that people we know from our surveys don\u2019t enjoy doing. And it\u2019s removing some of that and enabling, I think, much crisper, much more accurate outputs, but clearly not without its risks. You know, there\u2019s the whole issue around the ethics of it, some of the inherent biases, and the fact that it doesn\u2019t always give you the right answer. So, I think that message around the importance of humans in conjunction with the technology\u2014we heard that from just about every single organization we spoke to. And that doesn\u2019t go away.\nLIZZIE: Are those the main risks that companies are telling you about? The hallucinations? Spitting out wrong answers? Like, what do companies worry about?\nPETE: They certainly worry about those, Lizzie, but I think there\u2019s a number of other things they think about. Human beings fundamentally don\u2019t particularly enjoy change. I think those organizations that have seen the best returns on the investments and the best results are those where they\u2019ve been just really clear and embracing their workforce. We always talk about people-centered change, that people tend to adopt what they\u2019ve helped to create. And, I think, in this world of the introduction of GenAI, it\u2019s no different.\nLIZZIE: If you are an organization trying to get buy-in from your workforce, and have them embrace this technology, how do you do that?\nPETE: Gosh, we could do a whole podcast\u2026\nLIZZIE: [Laughs]\n\u2026on that very question. People tend to respond less positively to, I think, a top-down directive, in most cases. I think, as human beings, we want to understand what are the benefits of this? What does it mean for me? How\u2019s my work going to change? So I think the whole focus around communications and transparency is key. Secondly, it will impact some jobs. That\u2019s the nature of technology and disruptive innovation. What we are seeing, though, it\u2019s creating new jobs and new opportunities. And, I think, an adage we use a lot, is that you can protect people, but you can\u2019t protect jobs. Jobs will continue to evolve. They always will do.\nLIZZIE: If you have AI doing some of this sludge stuff, drafting emails, what have you, how do organizations figure out what to do with their workers if they have new productivity gains?\nPETE: That\u2019s a really interesting question, Lizzie, because I think in the early days, we\u2019re probably talking a year ago, those organizations that were adopting at the time, I think actually hadn\u2019t really thought through how are they capturing that capacity that\u2019s being freed up and actually what are they going to do with it? What we\u2019re seeing in some of the organizations that are maybe more mature in their deployment, where they\u2019re moving from those pilots into much more enterprise-wide deployments is, they\u2019ve been very deliberate around A, how they\u2019re capturing that capacity, that value, and B, how they\u2019re then redeploying that into other areas of their business which need those skills and capabilities in play. And, I think, for me, that\u2019s a really good example of in some organizations where we\u2019re seeing the skills-first, skills-based organization approach around that. How do you agilely move your skilled people to the right place at the right time? And as soon as you\u2019ve got GenAI in the mix, it, for me, opens up that skills-first approach.\nFEMI: In this GenAI era, Svenja Goodell said, When we\u2019re looking at the kind of skills that are needed in a workforce, leadership skills, communication skills, how do we nurture those kind of skills in a workforce?\nPETE: And actually, she\u2019s echoing what I\u2019ve seen. I think leaders in organizations are always short of colleagues with those skills. You listed them. Some people call them soft skills. I don\u2019t. I call them human skills. How do organizations engender that? Well, I think there\u2019s a variety of approaches. I think one is having a culture which has a growth mindset, which empowers the workers to develop themselves. It provides opportunities for them to upskill and to reskill. So we know workers want that opportunity to develop and have opportunity to learn new skills. On the opposite side, when you ask the workers the same question, but, does your employer give you that opportunity? Only 40% of workers say they work in an organization that they feel they\u2019re getting full and free access to skilling and development opportunity.\nLIZZIE: When we talk about a big societal shift, there is a risk of creating losers as well as winners. And so, when you think about skills and the workforce, what should policymakers be thinking about to provide that support where it\u2019s needed?\nPETE: I think the role of policymakers in all this is crucial. I think it\u2019s very easy as well for us to talk about GenAI as if it\u2019s mainstream. Well, we\u2019re fortunate and privileged enough that we have access. We have the software, the hardware, to be able to access it. That\u2019s not the case for everybody around the world. So, creating that equality of opportunity to be able to work with GenAI to learn the skills that are required.\nLIZZIE: What do you say to organizations that want to integrate AI but haven\u2019t started yet?\nPETE: Work out which elements of the processes within your organization are those that are pretty repeatable processes. Things that lends itself to the implementation of GenAI. I think, secondly, being clear about what it is you\u2019re expecting to see as the outcome and measuring your progress throughout that. I think, thirdly, it\u2019s being transparent and clear about the what and the why with your workers and your employee base. Create that narrative, and engage them on that journey. And, I think, organizations, the ones we\u2019ve spoken to where they started in that way, they\u2019ve been able to actually scale much faster, because they\u2019ve been learning all the way through in the smaller pilots, which they\u2019re able to then scale going forward.\nFEMI: If you could look back in five years from now, so we\u2019re in 2030, you look back at what AI has done for workforces around the world, what would be your top three positive changes, do you think?\nPETE: What a question Femi! I think, one, I think the whole makeup of the workforce will be different, as historically it has been. But I think we will see the emergence of and probably embedding of much more, what I call, digital workers working very closely with human workers. So we\u2014I think we will see the embedding of digital workers in workforces across most sectors.\nLIZZIE: Femi, that was completely fascinating to listen to, because I came away with, kind of, two overriding thoughts. Number one, workers need to be brought on board. There needs to be ownership and enjoyment of these tools. And number two, from Svenja, that these are tools, that they\u2019re not wholesale replacements for people, but something that we\u2019re just going to learn how to use.\nFEMI: And also, it\u2019s fast, so get ready. Be ready. Stand by. It\u2019s happening right now.\nLIZZIE: Well, that is it for today. Next time, we\u2019re going to be in Switzerland, for the first of two special episodes coming live from Davos, as we hear the latest developments from the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum!\nFEMI: To get every episode as soon as it\u2019s out, tap follow or subscribe in your podcast app.\n\nLIZZIE: Until next time, thanks for listening.\n\nFEMI: Take on Tomorrow is brought to you by PwC\u2019s strategy and business.

        "published_content": "In a world transformed by innovation, a people-driven, tech-powered tax function can create and sustain value within your organisation, leveraging the latest advancements to inspire a future of remarkable success.\nIn today\u2019s dynamic environment, organisations must reassess their tax operating models to address economic volatility, cost pressures, digital transformation and evolving regulatory requirements. To achieve excellence, it is essential to streamline operations and optimise tax processes through a sustainable, technology-driven strategy. At PwC, we integrate our extensive industry expertise with cutting-edge technology to enhance tax functions, develop customised transformation plans and realise strategic benefits. Embrace innovation and lead your organisation towards a future of exceptional success.\nClient priorities\nLeveraging advanced tax technology and transformation is crucial for navigating complex regulations and optimising operations. By integrating AI and automation, you can enhance efficiency and drive value creation.\nSkills gaps\nMany clients indicate a skills gap within their tax departments. The essential skills for the future include AI proficiency, data analytics and specialised tax knowledge. Organisations can evaluate their current skill sets, identify any deficiencies and invest in comprehensive training programmes to enhance proficiency in AI, data science and stakeholder engagement.\nAI and automation\nA significant number of our clients have experienced advantages from implementing AI, with many expecting it to revolutionise tax planning and strategy within the next three years. Organisations can establish priorities and use cases for AI, integrate a technology ecosystem and enhance team skills to fully exploit AI\u2019s potential in the tax function.\nResource challenges\nTax functions are under strain due to limited resources, increasing regulatory demands and the need to support strategic business decisions. Organisations can enhance the efficiency of daily tax operations by upskilling teams or hiring for the appropriate skills and expertise, as well as repurposing talent internally to more technology focused roles.\nOperating models\nAs many organisations continue to ride the business remodelling wave, the operating model discussion is becoming increasingly relevant for tax activities both in the short- to medium-term. They can assess their existing skills, technology and processes to address current and future needs, and balance these requirements against the expertise they can hire, purchase or develop.\nOur tax technology solutions\nProcess assessments\nMany organisations have kept their tax processes unchanged for years, potentially missing out on the benefits that modern technology can offer. It\u2019s important to assess whether tax processes are well-defined and efficient, and to explore opportunities for automation to enhance them. Ensuring that these processes are robust enough to withstand the increasingly demanding tax landscape is crucial, including incorporating strong data management procedures.\nAn effective tax transformation strategy not only addresses ineffective processes and resource limitations, it also empowers your team to be more innovative and agile. By aligning tax strategies with sustainability objectives, businesses can ensure they are meeting their corporate responsibility goals. The new tax professional will play a crucial role in this journey, using advanced technologies and AI to drive significant advantages. Companies are already seeing the benefits of these approaches, realising cost and efficiency gains across their operations, with the tax function being a key area of opportunity.\nAssessing the current tax operating model and designing and implementing future state transformation objectives are essential steps.\nAI integration\nResource constraints often pose significant hurdles for tax functions. The use of the right tools can alleviate these challenges, enhancing the work environment and fostering an innovative, agile team. As the tax landscape evolves, businesses are shifting towards comprehensive corporate responsibility, integrating tax strategies with sustainability goals. The new tax professionals will be key strategic advisors in this transition, leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as AI to gain substantial benefits.\nFor instance, tax compliance often involves reconciling financial transactions across multiple accounts, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming. By leveraging self-service data management and low-code tools, organisations can automate the reconciliation, validation and reporting processes. Harnessing the transformative potential of AI can help streamline tax operations, analyse complex and vast datasets, uncover discrete patterns and unlock new opportunities for tax transformation.\nReducing the time spent on existing tax processes can help businesses save resources, which can instead be used for continuous improvement opportunities and enhanced operational efficiency. This is particularly important in a cost-focused environment, allowing organisations to focus on activities with more aggregated value.\nEnterprise-wide automation\nWhen procuring tax technology, evaluate your existing enterprise platforms. Align your tax function with the scope and timing of ongoing and future transformations and other enterprise investments. Leveraging low-code automation and existing enterprise platforms for tax purposes is gaining traction. Assess whether your current software can be enhanced or modified, or if your business holds technology licenses that the tax team can use.\nIntegrating tax solutions driven by end-users is a practical approach compared to large-scale enterprise-wide transformation or tax engine implementation projects. Pursuing automation using existing enterprise platforms can be a compelling strategy for cost optimisation.\nRegulatory compliance\nIn today\u2019s rapidly evolving regulatory environment, staying ahead of compliance requirements is not just a necessity but a strategic advantage. By proactively developing and implementing comprehensive data management strategies, clients can ensure they are not only meeting the stringent requirements of obligations such as Pillar 2, DAC7, CESOP and other regulatory frameworks, but are also positioning themselves as leaders in their industry. These strategies enable organisations to streamline their data processes, reduce the risk of non-compliance and enhance their overall operational efficiency.\nIt is important that approaches encompass data extraction, manipulation, calculation, compliance and reporting obligations. Moreover, a robust compliance framework can significantly boost stakeholder confidence, demonstrating a commitment to transparency and accountability.\nLeveraging these strategies effectively can also unlock new opportunities for growth and innovation. By investing in advanced data management tools and practices, clients can gain deeper insights into their operations, identify areas for improvement and make more informed business decisions. This proactive approach to compliance not only mitigates risks, it also fosters a culture of continuous improvement and resilience. Ultimately, embracing these obligations as integral components of your business strategy can lead to sustainable success and a competitive edge in the marketplace.",

The new design could revolutionise a wide range of drug trials \u2013 ultimately benefiting patients everywhere.\nPwC X TED\nTogether, PwC and TED are asking some of today's most critical questions - and unlocking answers to the future, to show how AI theory can become real-world practice.",
